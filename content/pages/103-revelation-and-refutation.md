## DM Overview

In Episode I of the Eye of the Sun trilogy, "The Cularin Presence," the heroes discovered an elaborate base of operations for the Metatheran Cartel, hidden deep in the jungles of Cularin. A false sense of security came with that discovery, as things that were once unknown now became known, and therefore less threatening. Yet scarcely a week later, individuals and groups began disappearing from the major cities of Cularin, Gadrin and Hedrett. Episode II of the trilogy, "The Resistance Within," chronicled the heroes' attempts to locate the missing persons, and their ultimate discovery of a resistance movement dedicated to stopping the Cartel from destroying life as they know it in the system.

Now, the heroes are faced with a dilemma. The evidence is, at best, mixed, but the leader of the resistance has contacted them once more for help. She needs two things. First, she needs them to gather conclusive evidence of the Cartel's involvement in illegal activities, which she believes can be obtained in the records room of Gadrin's government offices. She then needs that information brought to her, at which point she will ask the heroes to join her in a raid on the Cartel compound. There, the heroes will help provide cover while her agents access the Cartel's computer system and obtain irrefutable evidence of wrongdoing, which they can then turn over to the proper authorities. Before anything an be done through official channels, however, the Cartel's jungle base is destroyed from orbit by a set of fire-linked turbolasers mounted on one of the Cartel's own ships, punishment from on high for a "rogue envoy" and the fools who followed him.

<p class="h4">Encounter 1: Arrested Development</p>
The heroes are approached by two representatives of the Office of Peace and Security (OPS) in full regalia, and asked to come answer some questions. The OPS officers have received information that the heroes know about the burgeoning resistance movement, and need to question them. The heroes are taken to an OPS station on the edge of Gadrin and then into a tunnel below, where the true meeting, with Gerta of the resistance, is to take place. Gerta explains that she needs the help of the heroes. They have legitimate positions in the community and can now access things she herself cannot. She needs information about how the Cartel obtained its charter, and whose palms might have been greased. Even her insiders at OPS can't help her; it's going to take some work.

<p class="h4">Encounter 2: Sneak & Peak</p>
The heroes must find a way to infiltrate the government offices in Gadrin, either through official channels or through less forthright means. Either way, they will have the opportunity to obtain several files on the Cartel, including (potentially) a file from a hidden directory. A personal datapad will also be found in the materials, with no identifying information on it, containing records of clandestine payments from Velin Wir to a highly placed government official.

<p class="h4">Encounter 3: Get Outta Town!</p>
Removing the files from the facility is not so easy, however, and results in alarms sounding. Using speeders borrowed from Gerta, the heroes must make a daring escape from Gadrin, dodging patrols all the way. If they are caught, they will be taken to the OPS offices, and eventually set free by Gerta's OPS contacts.

<p classs="h4">Encounter 4: A Crash Site</p>
A direct route to the resistance hideout is a bad idea, so the heroes must make a roundabout trip, which ends up taking them near a site where a shuttle crashed a few months back. Careful searching can turn up some interesting clues, both about what has happened so far, and about things that have not really been revealed yet but which may (or may not) become important as things progress. The wreckage contains a manifest for several suspicious parts, including turbolaser generators, but no such generator is to be found among the debris.

<p class="h4">Encounter 5: Cloud Mountain, Redux</p>
Armed with loads of information, the heroes make their way back to the headquarters of the resistance, deep in the mines of Cloud Mountain. The ride in the mining cars is blessedly uneventful (unlike in Episode II), because this time they have been given a passcode by Gerta. Unfortunately, the passage of so much traffic through some of the lower shafts has led to instability in the floor, and on the last leg of their journey the floor of the tunnel collapses, dumping them into the cavern below where a particularly unpleasant creature awaits. Once they defeat the creature, the resistance shows up and brings them the rest of the way, where their information is taken and digested. 
Unfortunately, it's not quite enough, so plans are made to infiltrate the Cartel's jungle base.

<p class="h4">Encounter 6: Preemptive Strike</p>
Equally unfortunate is the fact that somewhere along the way (either in Encounter 2 or Encounter 4), the heroes
managed to pick up a microtransmitter which allowed someone to follow them here. Now, however, the mine security works in favor of the heroes, and it doesn't take much to repel the strike force, who drag off their dead but leave behind some hints as to their identity.

<p class="h4">Encounter 7: Into the Hive</p>
The heroes should have every reason to assist the resistance at this point, since the only reason for the raid they're going to conduct is to gather the remainder of the information necessary to get the Cartel removed from Cularin. It's clearly the best thing for the planet to go in and get more information, and the intention is not to go in with guns blazing, everything will be set to stun. It's a precision strike where they will go in, get information, and escape as quickly as possible, but it hinges on having the heroes there as a separate strike team, since the resistance cannot continue to operate, defend its base, and send enough folks into the Cartel's base without them. The aftermath of the successful raid is pretty impressive...

Important Note to Judges: One of the biggest challenges here can be getting the heroes into the module, based on playtests. Included is a "note from Gerta." to help things along, but encourage the heroes to convince the others to join if they seem reticent. It's additional roleplaying.

## Encounter 1: Arrested Development

_Key ideas of this encounter: picked up by representatives of OPS; taken to a meeting with Gerta; asked to help the resistance gather the information needed to oust the Cartel_

As the adventure begins, it has been one month since the events of "The Resistance Within." It is assumed that all the heroes are on Cularin, for one reason or another. They either live here, are on-planet purchasing supplies, or what have you. They have just awakened when their room's comm-buzzer sounds. Someone is outside.

_**You roll out of bed to another hazy, humid morning. The air is thick today, and through your window you can see that a thick fog has settled over the city, obscuring vision beyond ten meters.**_

> _**The buzzer sounds again.**_

Once they describe their activities - stumbling out of bed, grabbing something to drink, whatever it is they want to do - and say they're opening the door, read the following.

_**A young man in the pressed whites of the Office of Peace and Security stands before you. He nods in greeting. "You are [pc name]? I need you to come with me, please."**_

This is Corporal Ortin, OPS officer and mole for the resistance. He is not here to put anyone under arrest. Instead, the heroes are needed to assist in a "matter of some urgency." Because they're not under arrest, they can bring anything they want with them, within the legal bounds on Cularin. In other words, weapons are fine.

Now, there are going to be heroes who are naturally not predisposed to go with Ortin. Two things can be done to prevent this. First and foremost, start with a PC who played "The Resistance Within," if any are available. Second, have Ortin hand them a small slip of paper and continue speaking as they read it. The note says: "Please go with this man. You are not in danger from him. GH." The image of a rising sun with strangely-shaped eyes is drawn at the bottom of the paper. Any hero who played "The Resistance Within" will immediately recognize the symbol as one decorating the mine where the resistance set up their base of operations, and GH as the initials of Gerta Haman, leader of the resistance.

Once they've had a chance to look at the paper, Ortin, still talking, will gesture for them to give it back to him, and will tuck it away in an interior pocket of his jumpsuit.

Ortin is not very communicative. He will gather the heroes one at a time, leaving the ones he's already collected waiting outside while he goes in to get the next, and when everyone is collected will excuse himself to make a short call on his comlink. At this point, you may allow the players to introduce themselves and describe their characters. Once they are done, Ortin will finish his communication and return.

_**"If you will come with me, we're going to the third sector precinct house."**_

The precinct house is about three blocks from, well, wherever they are, and is located on the west side of Gadrin. (In other words, make sure the last person you add to the party does not reside in Hedrett!) Ortin will remain close-mouthed about the nature of the summons, in part because he knows relatively little. This is slightly out of the ordinary, in terms of how OPS typically deals with civilians, but these are hardly ordinary times.

The walk is short, perhaps mercifully so because Ortin is so tight-lipped.

_**The third sector precinct house is a boxlike one-story structure with windows on its face, and a single door. Ortin strides to the door, punches in the passcode, and steps aside as the door slides up. "After you."**_

> _**Inside, the office is much like every other OPS office you've been in on Cularin (at least, in those city-states that require OPS as part of the community). Very neat, sparsely decorated, but small. And empty. There's no one else on duty right now. This is probably the smallest OPS office in Gadrin, if not on the whole planet. A pair of desks, a half-dozen chairs, and two other doors on the opposite side of the room from where you entered. One is labeled "holding area," the other "supplies."**_
>
> _**Ortin walks to the supply door and punches a 9- dight passkey into the panel on the wall beside it. The door opens with a whir, revealing a standard supply closet, full of cleaning supplies, extra datapads and chips, comlinks, and various small blasters. He looks over his shoulder at you as he reaches around the corner into the supply room and presses a button out of sight on the far side of the wall. As you watch, the back of the supply closet pivots, revealing a stairway leadingdown.**_
>
> _**Ortin steps aside. "After you."**_

Please note, we are not wedded to our box text. They can stop him at any time and ask him what's going on, and he'll tell them. The meeting is downstairs.

Do be careful not to tell them they've been summoned by OPS. This is just someone showing up in an OPS uniform to summon them, and taking them to an OPS precinct house. They're actually being summoned by the person downstairs.

If it will make the heroes feel better, Ortin will go down first to demonstrate there are no traps on the stairs, although he'll find it pretty funny that they ask him to do so. (Of course, he also didn't play "The Resistance Within...")

_**At the bottom of the stairs is a small room with a round table set with datapads for each of its nine seats. A familiar woman of middle years looks up as you enter and nods in greeting. Gerta Haman, head of the Cularin resistance.**_

### Option 1: Heroes Told E1-6RA Location of Resistance

If the majority of tables at Winter Fantasy 2001 decided to tell E1-6RA about the location of the resistance headquarters in "The Resistance Within," their reception will be chilly. Gerta has managed to find out who shared the information, and is not happy - particularly if any offending heroes are present!

_**"Please, have a seat. It appears that we are in need of your assistance again. Things have gotten... awkward for us, in our search for truth. I respect that you are individuals of principle, so I hope we can set aside any philosophical differences and discuss what I need done.**_

> _**"We've had some trouble lately. Being forced to move our base of operations will do that, and then after two weeks in the new locale, we began getting interference in our transmissions because of mineral deposits in the area, so we just spent several days relocating back to our original center. I tell you this because after tomorrow, it doesn't matter one way or another who knows where we are. We're confident the Cartel knows, and if we can't prove that they're behind all the recent trouble soon, they're likely to exterminate us.**_
>
> _**"After everything that happened, I was somewhat reticent to ask for your help, but too many of us would be noticed if we returned now, and the people I still have in the cities can't be jeopardized. Ortin is taking a huge risk doing what he's done today. So I must ask you - for the good of the system - help us find the truth."**_

From there, continue to the section marked "both contingencies."

### Option 2: Heroes at WF 2001 Did NOT Tell E1-6RA the Location

Gerta looks tense, but still greets the heroes with a smile.

_**"Please, have a seat. I appreciate the discretion of any of you who knew of our operation and kept it to yourselves for the last month.**_

> _**"I'll be brief. We are close to finding the last of the evidence we need to shut down the Cartel, but we're coming up short. We're almost out of time. We believe the Cartel knows about us, and if we can't prove that they're behind all the recent trouble soon, they're likely to exterminate us. They've done it before, very quietly, in other systems. Right now, we can't go public, and we can't gather the necessary information ourselves. Too many of us would be noticed if we returned now, and the people I still have in the cities can't be jeopardized. Ortin is taking a huge risk doing what he's done today. So I must ask you - for the good of the system - help us find the truth."**_

### Both Contingencies

What Gerta wants is simple. She needs information gathered that is not available through any network. It is only stored locally at the Cartel's original operations headquarters, here in Gadrin. They've retained that office as a PR location, and as a backup for their datatapes.

She needs the heroes to get into the Cartel's local HQ - however they see fit - and obtain the records for how the Cartel obtained their charter for Cularin, and the account records from the same time to see where large payments may have been made. Using the Cartel's nomenclature system, her slicers have determined that files beginning with 21cu and 8fi992 are going to be what's needed, but since filenames in the Cartel's systems are 10 characters, that's still going to be pretty substantial.

She has a datapad for them, which has several very nice - and highly illegal - pieces of software on it, custom designed to slice right into the Cartel's system and disguise any unusual activity as routine memory checks. Anyone with computer skill will, with a DC 13 check, recognize the style of the programming - it's consistent with Baylan's work, one of the slicers who's made a name for himself breaking and fixing computer systems all over the Core Worlds. He's something of a minor legend. Gerta will hedge around any questions as to who did the programming, just saying that she called in a favor or two. She will tell them to take care of the datapad, since it is what will get them past the security droids at the entrance to the Cloud Mountain mines.

She has also arranged for two speeders to be left at the north end of Gadrin, for them to use to escape into the jungle. If no one has piloting skills, she can have an autopilot set to bring the speeders right to the resistance headquarters.

She will not ask the heroes to do the job any particular way, and in fact would prefer if they didn't tell her at all, so that if she happens to get captured by the Cartel, she can't tell them anything. Once the conversation is at an end, she will thank the heroes and exit through a concealed panel in one of the walls, leaving the party to make some decisions on what to do next.

## Encounter 2: Sneak & Peek

_Key ideas of this encounter: gain entry to the Cartel's offices in Gadrin; attack their computer files; find a personal datapad with information on it; take the relevant information and get out of there!_

During the day, the Cartel's office in Gadrin is staffed with two individuals. Jyll Xon is a competent, if none- too-bright, secretary, and Manod Fea is the "office manager." Both are Caarites, and Jyll's smile is broader than even most of her species (she sometimes frightens small children). It literally stretches from ear to ear. Most of the Cartel's offices in Gadrin have been closed, and many of their warehouses have been vacated, since they admitted to the presence of their jungle base. This is the only office of the Cartel that remains open in Gadrin.

### Gathering Information About Daily Activities

Information about what goes on, day-to-day, in the Cartel office is relatively easy to obtain. Find out who would like to gather information (per the skill; remember, this can be used untrained if no one took the skill for their hero), and let them go at it. It will take a couple of hours of hanging out in bars and greasing palms, but information can be had, and in plenty of time for Manod to leave for lunch. For every 50 credits spent, reduce the target DCs listed below by one point. Thus, if a hero spends 100 credits on bribes, she only needs a 23 to find out about the flowers. Use the following chart as a reference for what they can find out, based on a successful check with different DCs. Each successive gradation knows all the information for lower levels, plus what is listed for their success level.

- DC 5: There is usually someone there from dawn until dusk.
- DC 10: Manod comes and goes, but Jyll is there all the time. The office has security cameras.
- DC 15: Manod is always gone for two hours right around noon. The security cameras have an external feed, so if you cut the comm cables on the outside of the building, their signal goes nowhere.
- DC 20: Jyll keeps a passcode sheet taped to the underside of her desk.
- DC 25: Jyll loves flowers, and gets them sent to her regularly from her significant other (who is still on Caarimon), but she is horribly allergic to several local kinds of greenery that Gadrin florists use in their arrangements.

Jyll can be distracted in any of a number of ways, frightened out of the building, etc., if the heroes go this route. If they learn about her allergy to the plants, they can use this to their advantage (a nice bouquet is 10 credits). Most Caarites are uncomfortable around cuttings from jo trees, and she's no exception. Her reaction is just more severe. She passes out and begins convulsing. Anyone with knowledge of healing will know that it's nothing life-threatening, she just needs to be made comfortable for when she comes around again.

### Gathering Information for a Night-Time Penetration

The heroes can also decide that it will be easier to break in. Again, information can be had, although here things are somewhat sketchier. It will take a couple of hours of hanging out in bars and greasing palms, but information can be had. For every 50 credits spent, reduce the target DCs listed below by one point. Thus, if a hero spends 100 credits on bribes, she only needs a 23 to find out about the hidden safe.

- DC 10: The office is empty by dusk. OPS patrols come by every half-hour. The office has security cameras.
- DC 15: The Cartel doesn't put their own security personnel on this place. They have it protected with an expensive security system that uses 2048-bit encryption on 7-character passwords. [Note: Yes, this will be sliced by the datapad Gerta provided. Baylan goes through 2048-bit encryption like butter.] The security cameras have an external feed, so if you cut the comm cables on the outside of the building, their signal goes nowhere.
- DC 20: The secretary, Jyll, keeps a passcode sheet for the computers taped to the underside of her desk.
- DC 25: There is a safe hidden behind the large bank of computers in the back room, set into the wall. Same encryption system as the front door.

FYI, 2048-bit encryption, using modern technology (yours and mine) would take YEARS to break. Literally. While the metric may be somewhat skewed for the Star Wars universe, it's okay to emphasize to any hero with a background in computers that this is SERIOUS encryption. In game mechanic terms, slicing this would take somewhere in the neighborhood of a DC 35 check, if one were required. But with Baylan's program, it's not.

Whether they go in during the day and manage to incapacitate Jyll, or go in at night after bypassing the security system, they will find the same things in three general areas.

_**The Cartel offices are somewhat askew, with the move to the new locale only a little over a month gone. Empty boxes still line several walls, and only one desk remains, topped with a computer terminal. A closed door is behind that desk, and another larger set of double doors are on the left wall.**_

If they don't learn about the security cameras and how to bypass them, give them spot checks (DC 17) to notice the comm cables outside the building and a check against electronics, computer use, or some relevant knowledge skill to figure out what it's for and how to disable it.

If the heroes arrive during the day, Jyll will be at her desk, and greet them with a smile. Once they have gotten her out of the picture (do make sure they know that killing her would be a bad idea; she just works here, after all!), you can give them the run-down on the building.

Jyll's work-station: Computer terminal with a datapad jack, lots of disks, memos and notes to herself about correspondence she must complete. Attached to the underside of the one drawer on her desk (DC 14 search check, or free if they specifically say they're looking there) is a sheet with passcodes to the computer system. Her computer does not provide access to the detailed information the heroes need.

Manod's office: This is through the door behind Jyll's desk. A small room off the main lobby of the Cartel building, it contains a desk topped with a much more elaborate computer terminal than Jyll's. It also has a datapad jack. Jyll's list of passcodes will allow access to Manod's computer, which provides access to some of the files (only the 21cu file hierarchy) the heroes are looking for.

The Back Room: **_Opening the door, you are greeted by the whir of dozens of fans, cooling the bank of computers that lines three of the four walls. A single master terminal is set into the middle of the bank opposite you._** The master terminal is where they can jack in the datapad and download exactly what they want. But while they're doing this, things get interesting (see below).

It's obvious that only one hero is going to be able to do the computer activity in this scene. That's okay. The others can stay busy. Searching is good, and a DC 20 search check will reveal a sliding panel behind the left-most bank of computers. This is the safe. It's got the same encryption as the front door, so unless someone wants to go for that DC 35 check, they probably ought to borrow the datapad while the files are being organized for download from the main system.

Botching it starts a silent alarm, and will bring both OPS and Cartel security within ten minutes. As with many things in Star Wars, however, if they can give you a good, cinematic description of what they would like to do to get the safe open, and have the relevant skills, give them a chance. Creativity and heroism go hand in hand, after all.

Inside the safe is a datapad with Velin Wir's personal insignia on it. While they can get all the files they need off the main system, this pad is a goldmine. It will require a DC 22 Disable Device roll to access it here, but if they do, the heroes will see that it contains Velin Wir's personal account logs, detailing payments to members of the Trade Federation as well as some very blatant palm-greasing of key support personnel of the Baron Administrators of both Gadrin and Hedrett. In other words, details on who was bribed for the controlling trade rights the Cartel now experiences. If the heroes don't find that out here, they can at least take the datapad back to Gerta. The datapad can be accessed using Baylan's program, but will present a false menu system that still requires the DC 22 check noted above to circumvent.

In the meantime, pick someone who's not doing much. Have them roll Spot or Listen checks (DC 10) to realize that there is someone poking around just outside the front door to the building.

_**A shadow moves across the window beside the door, and someone brushes the door. Once. Twice.**_

Find out what the heroes want to do. The person outside is actually Borus, the wild-eyed beggar of Gadrin, who detects as a Force-user (if anyone thinks to ask). If they wait, Borus will go away. If they open the door ready for a fight, Borus will cower, wave his hands in abject terror, and crawl away. He is a crusty old man with poor personal hygiene, and he doesn't speak much at all. He saw the heroes go in and wanted to see why they hadn't come out, since he thought he recognized some of them and knew they didn't like the Cartel. Regardless what they do, this is a good opportunity to make the heroes paranoid.

Here's the irony. If the heroes managed to locate the datapad, and take it with them, they now have a Cartel tracking device on them, since Wir always wanted to be able to know where his datapad was. Of course, if they didn't, the Cartel's computers will record the electronic signature of the datapad with Baylan's programs on it, and the heroes will be able to be tracked that way, but it's more fun to have them find the datapad, take it, and have them be tracked because of it than it is to have them tracked the other way.

There is no way to discern that anything is strange about the datapad. It has a standard paging mechanism built into its circuitry, but those are found in all datapads these days. It's the software that's been modified, to allow the paging system to be used to track the location of the device. Any modifications to the device are at your discretion, and should have a sizable (DC 17-20) difficulty for success to be achieved.

Once the download is complete and they've found everything they can find with search checks, they may proceed. And they should, because there are suddenly sirens in the distance...

## Encounter 3: Get Outta Town!

_Key idea of this encounter: an alarm sounds as they leave; they are chased through Gadrin to the edge of town, fighting if need be; if captured, they are released by resistance members_

_**You step into the street outside the Cartel offices and hear the distant sirens getting closer, and louder. Suddenly, behind you, the building lights flash and an alarm begins to blare from the offices you just left!**_

_**At this point, if you had a soundtrack, it would be some sort of chase music. Because that's where we're headed.**_

### If It's Night

The heroes may have temporarily disarmed the door, but the door rearmed automatically after they had been inside for a few minutes. And since there's no security panel on the inside of the building, if they go out and do not immediately use the datapad on the security system again (and almost no groups will - and you are NOT to prompt them!), the alarm will go off, because no one is supposed to be exiting at this time of night.

### If It's Day

Jyll came close enough to consciousness to activate a transmitter hidden in her left wrist, and set off the alarms as they left.

Regardless, things have just started getting interesting for the heroes.

They have seven blocks to cover to get to the edge of town if they go straight north. Each block is fifty meters long. There is a Cartel security speeder coming south on the street, directly toward them, blocking their exit from the town. There are also three other Cartel speeders coming this direction, converging on the headquarters.

As ever, the heroes have options.

### Fighting

They can fight the speeder that's coming toward them. There are four Caarite guards in it, each armed with a stun baton. In round 3, another speeder with 4 more guards will arrive, and another speeder with 4 more guards in round 6.

> **Cartel Guard Squad (4): Caarite Thug 5;** IM +2; Def 12; Spd 10 m; VP/WP -/12; Atk +6 melee (1d6+1, stun baton, DC 10 Fort save if hit or fall unconscious for 2d6 rounds), +7 ranged (1d2 thrown baton); SQ none; SV Fort +5 Ref +3, Will +1; SZ M; FP 1; Rep 1; Str 12, Dex 14, Con 12, Int 8, Wis 10, Cha 9.
>
> **Skills:** Intimidate +4, Jump +2, Profession (Security) +2.
>
> **Feats:** Persuasive, Dodge, Weapons (simple), Armor (light).

Note that the DC for the stun batons is lower than that in the rulebook because they were constructed by Caarites and attuned to stunning species that more directly threaten Caarimon, who have slightly different nervous systems than the species common in the Cularin system.

If the heroes are defeated, OPS will show up the round the fight ends and take the heroes into custody. They will be taken to an OPS station where they will be left to stew for a few hours. Thus, the Cartel cannot even take back what has been stolen yet. Eventually, you will get to read the following, but make them sweat a little first and try their hand at escaping. Just before they succeed in freeing themselves...

_**The door to the holding area swings open and Ortin steps through. He looks cautiously over his shoulder, shakes his head, and pulls out a small datapad. He presses a button and the cell door swings open. "Here's your gear." He hands you a box with all your weapons and other stuff that had been confiscated in it, including the datapad with all the key information on it.**_

He will then help the heroes to get to the edge of Gadrin, and their speeders.

### Parlaying

The Cartel guards cannot be bought, but they are typically weak-minded thugs. Jedi mind tricks thus impose an additional -2 penalty on these particular Caarites. Caarites who are convinced "These are not the thieves you're looking for" will actively attempt to stop any of their companions who try to hurt, stun, or arrest the heroes, allowing an opportunity for escape.

### Running

Just running works, as long as they don't run directly toward the oncoming Cartel speeder. It will take 15 rounds to reach the speeders in this way, and there is a 10% chance each round that the heroes will be spotted by a member of one of the Cartel search teams. This 10% is adjusted down to 5% if any of the heroes make a successful DC 14 Hide check during that round. If they are spotted, they may attempt to hide again, in which case you can do opposed spot checks for the Cartel guards against the Hide check of the party when the guards pass where the heroes are hiding.

A run-in with the Cartel guards should be run using the stats above, although here the reinforcements arrive in rounds 4, 8, and 12 instead of 3, 6, and 9, due to the guards not all being in the process of converging on a single location any more.

Once they reach the speeders, one way or another, they can get the heck out of Gadrin...

## Encounter 4: A Crash Site

_Key ideas of this encounter: coming across a crash site of a shuttle, the heroes may search and find clues; a manifest points to suspicious parts that are not present in the wreckage_

_**You tear out of Gadrin in the speeders, zipping into the jungle, through and around the trees. Any sounds of pursuit soon fade in the distance as you move deeper into the lush green of your surroundings.**_

_**The path programmed into your speeders [or recommended] by Gerta's people takes you on a roundabout trip, rather than going directly to the base. Still, you're moving in the right general direction.**_

Have the players roll Spot checks as they travel. If you like, lead them to believe that they're looking for the great lizards. That's what they should be worried about. You're only looking for a DC 10 Spot check, since they're trying to spot a crashed shuttle, for crying out loud!

And if they all miss it the first time, they can make another pass. When they finally spot it (feel free to describe the speeder going around in circles if this takes a while!), read the following:

_**In the bushes, you spot something! A glint of metal through the leaves... it looks like a ship.**_

Which, of course, it is. A crashed Incom A-23 Treeduster, broken neatly in two by the impact. Searching the craft site reveals the following (again graduated against the success of the search roll; note that there is no rush here, so taking 10 or 20 or whatever works fine; as always, high rolls have access to all information from easier rolls, but share the wealth - if someone rolls a 20, don't just give them everything, give some to the folks who rolled 5s and 10s as well):

- DC 2: There is a big ship broken in two here.
- DC 5: The ship had a substantial cargo, but it
  seems to have scattered all over the place.
- DC 10: A large number of broken circuits are scattered throughout the crash site. They are
  marked, "Guidance" in very fine print.
- DC 15: A datapad slid under that prickly bush over there. Its power cells are still good, and it contains
  the ship's manifest.
- DC 20: Someone has been here. There are tracks
  around the area, but they don't lead anywhere, they were probably picked up by a hovering shuttle.

Note that the tracks can also be located with the tracking feat, DC 12. The manifest readout is included as [Player Handout A](/player-handouts/103a). None of the weapons are here, except for a few broken items (one smashed vibro-ax and an entire case of 24 ruined blasters). The only things that are not broken and scattered around the clearing are the other two axes, the cannons, and the turbolaser generators, all of which are missing.
A computer skill check with DC 12 will allow the datapad to be identified as belonging to the Cartel, based on its encryption scheme.

## Encounter 5: Cloud Mountain, Redux

_Key idea of this encounter: arrival at Cloud Mountain; entry, and a nice, quiet ride down the mine shaft; then an unfortunate incident with the floor_

_**The remainder of your trip to Cloud Mountain is uneventful. Your speeders stop at the base of the mountain, just below the long, clear-cut stretch on the north face. It looks less menacing than it did last time, for some reason - perhaps because now, you have a better idea of what lies beneath.**_

_**The mountainside is relatively steep, with not a tree, bush, or meaningful clump of grass anywhere on it. Just dirt and rocks, from where you stand all the way to where the mountain disappears into the clouds, a swath a hundred meters wide all the way up. The brown of the mountainside is broken only by a black spot several hundred meters up, surrounded by a gleam of silver. That, you remember, is the entrance to the mines.**_

Nothing sounds like it's going to come out of the surrounding jungle at them this time. That should be a welcome relief. The entrance to the mine is as they remember it, but now they know how to bypass the access panel to the side of the doors and disable the droid security system. Using Baylan's datapad, they can ensure that the droids are shut down, and have a nice, easy ride in the turbocarts as they are carried down into the mines. The tunnels are well lit after the first 100 meters, so they can see lots of details.

_**The ride through the mineshafts is much less stressful without heavily armed droids trying to kill you. This time, you're actually able to take a look at the tunnel walls, at the intricate tracks of colored rock that criss- cross them, at the strange spiral patterns in the stone, at the slight charring where the laser drill was left in one place for too long. From a more leisurely perspective, this is actually a very beautiful cave system. You probably would have expected no less from Cloud Mountain, though.**_

Reaching the bottom, they see the blast doors have been removed and set off to one side, a large dent in them roughly the shape of a turbocart, with another sizable dent of about the same shape as a security droid with a raised blaster. The only useable tunnel, as before, leads off to the right.

_**You travel several hundred meters through familiar terrain. However, something is different. The walls and floor have been stripped of a great deal of their metal - apparently by someone in quite a hurry, as jagged pieces of wall and floor remain, but for the most part the rock now stands exposed. Ahead of you, another patch of metal catches your eye off to the right, one of the covers for a failed drilling location emblazoned with Sunburst Mining's emblem. Beside it, on the wall, is the access panel to the first set of blast doors.**_

The heroes may cringe internally if they remember what's behind this door. Heck, they may cringe externally! But again, Baylan's datapad will come in handy, and will display the password to the door when it is connected: RAVI. Entering this deactivates the security system. Of course, that doesn't matter too much, since the security in this room consisted of moving walls, and those walls have been dismantled, as have the tracks in the floor on which they ran. As such, entering any password will work. If you want, have the datapad flake out on them, due to the mineral deposits all around, and be unable to function. Make them sweat a little, and then whatever they enter, they're fine.

**_The door slides open in front of you, revealing a circular stone room with a vaulted ceiling. Part of a large machine stands against the far right wall, its pieces scattered over the floor. An open doorway awaits you on the other side of the room._**

The room is ten meters square. In addition to the door on the wall directly opposite them, there is a door at the far right-hand corner of that same wall.

The problem with this room is that the floor is weak. There is a reason the floors of the mine were covered with metal plates when the mine was in operation - other mine shafts lie directly below them. And as soon as two party members enter the room (or more, if they move in together; have a marching order, since they can go through the door three abreast, it's a broad doorway), have everyone in the room roll Reflex saves (DC 10). Everyone outside the room needs to roll a DC 5 Reflex save. Success means they slide easily down the pile of rubble to the bottom. Failure means they fall like - well, like rocks. And take 1d6 damage as they drop into the next mine shaft down.

Ascension guns will not help. The ceiling above the hole is dirt, and does not provide purchase for the guns to be able to pull the heroes out. Anchoring on the underside of the floor is also impossible - again, because the floor is weak and will just fall down when they start rising on the cable.

The real problem is the two-headed, purplish worm creature, about seven feet long, that rises up to attack when the heroes land and wake it up. There is no surprise round, since the dua-wurm was sleeping and the heroes were falling, so you start the fight on straight initiative.

> **Dua-wurm: Predator 6;** IM +1; Def 17 (+7 natural, +1 dex, -1 size); Spd 15 m (burrow 20 m); VP/WP 46/17; Atk +7 melee (bite x 2; 1d4 bite+2 + 1d2 acid), +6 ranged; SQ multiattack (using natural bites from separate heads incurs no penalties to attack rolls, so both heads attack at full attack bonus); SV Fort +7 Ref +4, Will -1; SZ L; FP 0; Rep 4; Str 15, Dex 14, Con 14, Int3,Wis4,Cha3.
>
> **Skills:** Intimidate +9, Hide +11, Swim +4.
>
> **Feats:** Toughness, Power Attack.

The dua-wurm attacks with both its heads, but because of its physiology cannot attack the same target with both heads. Its bite does both piercing and acid damage as dozens of needle-like teeth puncture the victim's flesh and insert acid into the wound. The acid will continue doing 1d2 damage per round, cumulative per bite, until it is either treated medically or rinsed from the wound.

After the fight is over, read the following:

**_The sounds of running feet and shouted orders find your ears. "What yousa doen dere? Comen outta dat hole now!"_**

Heroes who played "A Cularin Presence" will recognize the gruff Broof Yurdel, one of the leaders of the resistance. Broof and his squad of Gungans will help the heroes out, and take them to Gerta.

## Encounter 6: Preemptive Strike

_Key idea of this encounter: tracking the heroes, a hit squad from the Cartel shows up at the mines; they blast through the security droids and a shootout ensues in the main corridor; Gerta goes down before the hit squad is repelled_

**_Broof and his soldiers lead you through the mines, deeper than you went before. A long hallway stretches out before you, an open doorway at its end. You can hear the familiar whirring of a large bank of computers._**

**_With the Gungans ahead of you, you traverse the corridor and enter the operations center. Computers are set up in rows, stretching from one wall almost all the way to the far wall, banks upon banks whirring through computations. Gerta is hunched over the terminal at a computer station off to your left. She looks up as you enter, and waves you over._**

**_"Welcome! Were you successful?"_**

If the heroes hand over the datapad(s), she will immediately begin downloading information into the computer system. The datapad with the manifest from the crashed shuttle she will look at worriedly and call over Broof, who will look and nod. **_"Bombad turbolaser. Big boomer."_** In other words, someone just brought in parts for a large turbolaser array.

Wir's datapad she will examine closely, smiling the entire time. **_"Great records. Almost perfect. Just missing one piece. Let me see if it's in the rest of what you brought."_**

Moving on to the information from the Cartel's computers:

**_Gerta watches the filenames scroll across her screen, eyes wide. "This is perfect. This is it. Except for one thing..." She taps the screen. "See here? File transfers. We're missing two key files, and they've been transferred to the main Cartel headquarters. Broof, get a strike force ready. We have to go in."_**

**_Broof smiles. "Wesa ganna make da bombad Cartel pay now."_**

**_"No, Broof. All weapons set to stun. I'm trusting you to do this right." Gerta takes a deep breath and looks at you. "Some of you have been in there. Would you go with the strike force? To make sure they get in and out safely?"_**

The heroes are not obligated to agree to do anything. Not yet, at least. Of course, going in with the Gungans and Nim'Ri is the appropriately heroic thing to do, and there's more than enough preliminary information to point toward the Cartel being a bunch of nasty jerks - but she's right. Two key files are missing, and there's no way to get past the Cartel's firewall. If there were, they would have already done it!

Note that Gerta will consent to allow the use of deadly force, if it becomes necessary, but doesn't want to be the one to draw first blood. If it comes to battle, it needs to be the Cartel that fires first.

Once the heroes have made their decision, Gerta will excuse herself. She needs to go finalize arrangements for the raid - it's been a possibility for a while, now she just has to notify the raiders that the mission is a go - and wants the heroes to stay and debrief, reporting everything they can about what they saw.

Kris Wahl, the dilettante who is still being sought by his rich parents, is the one who will do the interviewing. Begin with the quietest player, and read the following.

**_Someone taps you on the shoulder. Turning, you see a smiling young man in impeccably neat clothes. He wears his shirt unbuttoned and does his best to lean rakishly against the bank of computers, but you can't get past the affable, almost boyish face. Add to that the fact that his clothes look like they were picked out from a costume shop to make him appear to be a scoundrel, and the effect is fairly amusing. You immediately recognize Kris Wahl, noted Cularin socialite (or fop, as the case may be)._**

**_"Why don't we talk? Tell me what you saw in their Gadrin headquarters. Anything interesting?"_**

Let the heroes roleplay with Wahl a little bit. He's a fluffy individual, very concerned with his appearance, but also very concerned with the safety of his home planet. He's seen manipulation by the powerful before, and doesn't want his home destroyed.

If asked, Wahl can check the computers and explain that while the files the heroes brought back contain all the necessary information to put the Cartel away, they lack verification file codes. That is what's missing.

Go through a couple of heroes if you need to. Treat this as a, "Tell me what you've done, so that I can feel good about giving a lot of money to this resistance" thing for Wahl. He loves heroic stories, and the grander, the better. He recognizes that he's a money man, and won't ever get to be a hero on his own, so he lives vicariously through the stories of the folks he supports.

After the second hero describes what they've done to help keep the planet safe, they will be interrupted by box-text.

**_Claxons begin to wail, and Wahl looks up, eyes wide. "Someone's in the compound!" Already, Gungans and others are grabbing up weapons and heading for the corridor._**

So here's the deal. The heroes accidentally brought back a transmitter that allowed the Cartel to track them. Whether it's a physical transmitter or a program that turns their personal datapad into a transmitter doesn't matter, but they are transmitting. As they are getting ready to leave and either go watch or participate in the fight, have one of the technicians working with whatever datapads the heroes brought back begin swearing rather loudly. She (Jo'Ara Gier, a Cerean) has just found the transmitter (if they brought back either Velin Wir's datapad or the datapad with the manifest) or has found the code that made it possible to trace Baylan's datapad and is in the process of deleting it.

She will encourage the heroes to go take care of things. She can de-bug the pads.

**_You race through the tunnels, back toward the surface. Above the sound of the claxons, you can hear the unmistakable noise of blaster fire echoing off the rock walls. It stops for a moment, and you hear the sounds of rushing feet coming toward you from somewhere far ahead. Then the blaster fire begins again, with increased fervor._**

What happened is simple. The Cartel hit squad just came in and took out the security droids. Now they're in a firefight with the resistance group. Whatever's going on, it's up around the next bend. The heroes can either go up and see about helping, or stay back. Note what they do here on the critical events summary at the end of this scenario, please.

### Staying Here

If the heroes all stay here, they're all safe, and after a few tense minutes, the blaster fire stops.

**_For a few long seconds, the tunnels are silent. Then, from around the corner, comes Broof. He carries a limp body in his arms. It's Gerta._**

She's dead. Dead and gone. She got caught in the crossfire coming out of a side tunnel, and was killed.

### Going to the Fight

If any of the heroes go to the fight, run the encounter this way. The ones who stay behind can just hear about it.

**_Rounding the corner, you see a massive battle taking place in front of you. Blaster fire rips through the air, coming from somewhere far down in the darkness of the tunnel. From nearer you, the Gungans, Nim'Ri, and several other resistance members are firing into the darkness._**

_Spot_ checks. DC 15. Gerta is huddled in a side tunnel about 20 meters down the corridor, trying to figure out how to get back to her people. From the look in her eyes, she looks like she's ready to just bolt. She is. Hopefully, one of the heroes will notice her and tell the rest of them - quickly - what's going on. If not, one of the soldiers will point her out. Since they're all going to be aware she's there, no one is flat-footed when she makes a break for it.

**_From a side corridor Gerta bursts forth, running at top speed toward you. No sooner has she taken a step, though, than she's taken down by a blaster bolt in the back! She falls and continues crawling toward you, but she's still at least 15 meters away, and all the blaster fire from the other end of the tunnel now seems to be trained on her._**

The choice is this. Going out there means maybe not coming back. Probably not, even. There are at least five individuals with blasters down there in the dark, and one person in the open makes a prime target. Not acting means Gerta dies.

The players have ten seconds REAL TIME to decide what to do. This is not a time for deliberation, it's a time to do - or do not. After those ten seconds are up, the blaster fire increases around Gerta, and if no one moves to help, she's dead in a round.
Relevant stats for Gerta... she weighs 51 kg (convenient, yes?). Prone, she has a defense of 11, and only has 10 WP left. That's all you need to know to see if you kill her with the barrage of 16 blaster bolts.

Once the first hero moves - if any of them do - it takes a round to get to Gerta and pick her up, and a round to get back with her in tow. This means you get a lot of shots with those blasters.

If the hero going after Gerta falls in round 1, their momentum will carry them to land on top of her, shielding her body. In round 2, Gerta will be dropped in front of the hero, where she can be dragged to safety by her people, with the PC close behind. At any point, if the individual who went to retrieve Gerta falls, Broof will act.

**_Broof stands, raising his blaster in the air. "Wesa ganna blast someone now!" And he throws himself over the top of the rock he'd been using for cover and race down the tunnel, firing into the darkness. A swarm of his Gungan soldiers follow, blasters blazing as well. The blaster fire from the far end ceases quickly._**

### Either Scenario

**_Broof looks at you. "Wesa ganna go stop da bombad Cartel now. Yousa comen? Wesa needen' yousa." He pauses as one of his soldiers runs up to him and hands him a blaster. A small Cartel insignia is worked into its grip. He looks at the bodies of several fallen friends and grits his teeth. "Wesa setten for stun. Not!"_**

## Encounter 7: Into the Hive

_Key ideas of this encounter: getting to the cartel base and entering; heroes go one way to find the files, while the rest of the resistance does the fighting; finding the files, escaping_

You can give the heroes the chance to not go, but Nim'Ri is going to come talk to them.

**_As you stand in the corridor, watching the resistance cleaning up the mess and readying to mobilize, Nim'Ri moves away from the crowd and approaches you. "I hope you'll help us. Some of you have been inside their facility, haven't you? We've got the blueprints for the base, but you've actually seen the place. You know a little more of it than we do." He looks over his shoulder at Broof. "I can't control him. If he wants to go in and get himself killed, it's what he's going to do. But no one says you have to be involved in that part of it._**

**_"Broof is muscle. He and his Gungans are going to provide offense. We need you to make your way to their central terminal and download the two missing files. Their designations are 21cu9a and 8fi992b11. Use this," he hands you a familiar datapad, "and be careful. We can't afford any more losses. Especially of good people like yourselves. The blueprints are in that pad. Will you do it?"_**

The map is included as [DM Aid #1](/gm-aids/103-1). It may be shared with players. Unfortunately, it isn't labeled as to which room is which, but heroes who took part in "The Cularin Presence" can attempt a DC 10 Intelligence check to remember that they are with computers was most likely C2. For every 3 points above 10 they get on their int check, they get information on one more room, beginning with A1 and working sequentially. Thus, a hero who makes a DC 16 int check will remember not only where the computers probably are, but also will recognize what rooms A1 and A2 are, from their previous time in the Cartel headquarters.

If the heroes agree to help, cool. If not, well, the module's pretty much over. The Gungans will succeed without them, and you can skip to the conclusion using the linking text, **_You are escorted back to Gadrin by a very somber young resistance fighter who seems disappointed that he's not able to go along with the Gungans..._**

Now, if they agree, they have some excitement ahead of them.

**_Broof doesn't grumble any more as he finishes up preparations and leads his soldiers and another fifty members of the resistance out of the mines. This leaves a little under a hundred people behind to defend from any further attacks, which should be enough._**

**_Half-way to the Cartel compound, Broof calls a halt and grudgingly instructs the members of the resistance to set their blasters to stun once more. "S'what Gerta wanted." Some of them actually follow the order._**

Do find out if the heroes decide to "set for stun" or not.

**_You should be coming up on the Cartel compound, and sure enough, one of the advance Gungan scouts comes back through the bushes and begins speaking to Broof in hushed tones. Broof waves you over._**

**_"Wesa ganna take out the guards. Yousa can comen, or stayen here. When guards are gone, wesa all goen in."_**

If the heroes want to go help kill/stun the Cartel guards, that's fine. There are six Cartel guards wandering around the clearing just in front of the entrance to their compound. They look nervous, like they expect something to happen. The line of Gungans, humans, and various other species are going to blast the half-dozen soldiers into oblivion, all from virtually hidden positions behind the treeline. The guards won't even have a chance. Somehow, it won't look like many people are actually set for stun, in spite of Broof's orders. Let the heroes roll some dice, if they want to shoot. The soldiers have a defense of 15, 9 vitality points and 11 wound points.

Once the soldier-guards are taken out, they may proceed inside.

As soon as they enter, Broof blasts the door controls for Area B1. This may seem impulsive, but Broof recognizes the security symbol of the Cartel on the door to B1, and has correctly identified B1 as security barracks. This does, unfortunately, trigger the alarms.

**_As the alarms begin to sound, blaster fire erupts from the far end of the hallway!_**

This blaster fire is coming from area B3, and it's VERY heavy. Given that the heroes need to get to C2, things just got a lot more difficult, because they can't just take a straight approach. They'll be gunned down almost instantaneously. So they have to go the long way around, and hope for the best.

**_"Go!" Broof waves you down the corridor from which there is no blaster fire coming. "Yousa goen that way, wesa doen da fighting!" And with that, he begins returning fire down the corridor._**

**_Blaster bolts streak in both directions, bouncing off the walls, and it's clear the resistance doesn't have a good position. There's no telling how many Cartel soldiers wait at the far end of that corridor!_**

If they just say, "We take off!" don't feel like you have to bludgeon them with the box text. Find out where they're going, and if they plan to stop anywhere along the way.

### A1 - Personnel Office

Three desks line the walls in this office, each manned by a protocol droid - one gold, one silver, one black. LS-121, Y4-E, and 3B-IR have worked for the Cartel for some time, and know a great deal about the personnel within the organization and their current assignments. At this moment, the droids can tell the heroes, there are three cooks in the mess hall (B2 on the map), two guards in the security office (C1), and approximately 100 guards and other employees in the staging area (B3) receiving instructions for a vital operation of some sort. There is no other way out of the staging area than the main hall, and the droids' sensors indicate that the odds of any of the Cartel guards successfully navigating from one end of the hall to the other are 7,940 to 1. They cannot compute odds for going across the field of fire, if asked, because there is a zero probability that any Cartel employee would be foolish enough to try that.

The droids do not have access to the records the heroes want. Those can only be accessed from the Records Room (C2), where there is only one individual currently. Velin Wir.

### A2 - Storage Room

The room is packed to overflowing with cleaning supplies. The only interesting non-cleaning supply is a box labeled "Aquata breathers."

### B1 - Barracks

The barracks are constructed to house 200 soldiers. Not all of them are here now, however, about half are out on patrols, and none of the soldiers are in the barracks. They are all in the staging area. It doesn't matter much, since Broof blasted the controls for the doors and it would take a lot of work to get in here. The soldiers have all of their useful gear with them anyway.

### B2 - Mess Hall

It's coming up on time for the evening meal, so the long tables are laid out from one end of the mess hall to the other, and in the far back corner, beneath a table, cower three Filordi cooks. They brandish kitchen utensils, but do not constitute a real threat to the heroes.

### B3 - Staging Area

This is where all of the soldiers are, shooting down the corridor at the Gungans and the other resistance fighters. The two groups have each other pinned down, and neither is going to risk a charge. This works out better for the heroes, since they have an alternate way to get where they need to be by following the corridor that leads around the A-section rooms and then making a dash across the firing. Not ideal, but better than running at them head-on. There are 125 second-level Caarite soldiers down there, although only twenty-five can get reasonable shots down the corridor at any given time.

### C1 - Security Headquarters

A large "SECURITY" sign on the door of this announces exactly what this is. Inside are the means to deactivate every security protocol in the building. This much, the heroes can figure out before they even open the door. So if they decide to do something like chuck a thermal detonator into the room and then slam the door shut again, that's cool. Even if they haven't talked to the droids in A1, they can safely assume the security station is manned. However, they don't have blasters readily accessible. They store their blaster rifles in the security case on the wall, and it will take them a full round to get to their guns before they can retaliate against any blaster fire.

### C2 - Records

Getting to records is a problem. Feel free to use the box-text below to describe why.

**_You come around the corner and see the corridor ahead of you. At the far end of it is a door that leads into the records room, but getting to that door is going to be a challenge. Between you and the door is a hallway five meters wide, the air full of blaster fire. Bolts tear back and forth, and you can hear screams from both directions. It doesn't sound like anyone's set for stun at all. And your destination is across that blaster-ridden hallway._**

If the heroes can come up with a creative solution, that's great. But crawling across the floor or over the ceiling or what have you will make them a target for the Cartel, even if it doesn't make them a target for the resistance. Probably the best option is to just rush or jump across. If they do this, they need to make a reflex save with DC 10 to race across the corridor without getting hit (if they have something that should modify that save, let it modify, that's fine). Making the save means they get across, no problem. FAILING the save means they've tripped. You get one attack roll on them, using the attack bonus for one of the Cartel guards
described below, before they can get themselves clear. Scare them if you like, but try not to kill anyone here.

Once they're all across, they can easily access the door. Using Baylan's datapad, it opens easily.

**_The blast door slides aside, revealing a large room filled from wall to wall with computers. A small figure stands near one of the terminals, and as he turns you recognize the wide features and too-broad smile of Velin Wir._**

**_"Hello, friends." He looks at you almost sadly. "It appears this is where we part ways." And with that he reaches into the folds of his cloak and pulls out a foot- long metal cylinder. He raises it before him, and the lightsaber springs to life!_**

No, of course he's not a Jedi! He's a Force Adept who managed to get his hands on a lightsaber, and he doesn't even particularly know how to use it. Quite honestly, he's hoping to scare the heroes away, not knowing that they are faced with a choice between one Caarite with a lightsaber, or 125 Caarites with blasters.

The challenge here is that blasters really shouldn't be used in this room, if the appropriate information is going to be gathered from the computers. Feel free to give Wisdom checks to have heroes figure this out. So it's looking like melee. Fortunately, Wir is not much of a fighter, and will attempt to distract the heroes by smashing a non-critical computer with his lightsaber in the first round if no one manages to close to melee with him, and escape through a panel in the southeast wall, beneath one of the terminals. He will fight to the death, and if he is disarmed will die immediately since his lightsaber was a "gift" from Riboga, and with it came a price. If the lightsaber is ever more than ten feet from him, a small thermal detonator goes off in Wir's chest, killing him instantly. This is a shaped charge, effectively, so while it may make a mess on anyone escorting him, it won't harm them. The noise it makes going off is something of a muffled "BOOM" followed by a "shplort!" The lightsaber then ceases functioning. Everything has a price when dealing with a Hutt...

The files are easy to retrieve from the computer, and by the time the heroes get back out into the corridor, the Cartel guards have realized their inferior position (no escape route) and surrendered. They are being led out, hands on their heads, by the Gungans.

## Conclusion

**_You walk outside, into the cool of early evening, leaving the Cartel's base behind you. In the datapad you carry is the information you need to prove the wrongdoing of the Cartel and restore order to the planet. As you clear the base, you happen to look back over your shoulder. Just then, a bolt of energy streaks from the sky, slamming into the front of the base and sending the entire compound up in a massive explosion!_**

And yes. That DID look like what a couple of large, fire-linked turbolasers, fired from orbit, would look like. Everyone was out of the base, but the compound is utterly destroyed. Shaken, the heroes can make their way back to the resistance headquarters, turn over the datapad, and then head back for the cities.

**_A grand celebration is planned for the next day, to commemorate the destruction of the Cartel's base in the jungle and to recognize you as heroes. Around mid-day, a landing craft settles on a pad just outside Gadrin, and several Caarites make their way into town. They go immediately to the office of Barnab Chistor, Gadrin's governor. Within the hour, they leave his office, and depart the planet._**

**_That night, you are led to the celebration. A platform has been erected at the base of Reidi Artom's statue, and as the fanfares play you walk to the platform and see Governor Chistor waiting for you. He raises his hands as you mount the platform. The leaders of the resistance stand beside him, having already received medals and adulation._**

**_"Friends, on this grand day we celebrate the heroism of our own in removing a rogue member of the Metatheran Cartel, whose designs on Cularin endangered life as we know it!_**

**_"On behalf of the people of Cularin, I thank you," he looks at each of you in turn, then again to the members of the Resistance, "for your bravery. Velin Wir was a blemish on the face of the Cartel, and they have withdrawn from our planet, for a time, to attempt to discover whether others of his kind are present in the organization. We have been asked to assist in the investigation, and we shall, but all of the credit for this great feat goes to these individuals. So thank you, from all the people of Cularin!"_**

**_The last sentence is all but drowned out, as the crowd erupts in cheers and fanfares blare._**

**Here Ends _Revelation and Refutation_**

### Experience Point Summary

Experience is calculated as follows for Living Force events.

1. Experience awards in the SWRPG are not made for achieving objectives, but instead for successfully completing an adventure of a given length. Thus, if the heroes survived and accomplished the primary goal of the adventure, they receive full Adventure Experience (600 xp for core LF plot scenarios, 350 for non-core LF scenarios).
2. Assign discretionary role-playing experience (0- 400 points). These should reward accurate character portrayal throughout the adventure, not just how well the PC interacted socially. Do NOT automatically award max roleplaying XP, consider carefully how well the players stayed in-character. This is your opportunity to reward appropriately cinematic behavior, so use it!

### Adventure Experience Award:

- Did the heroes succeed in infiltrating all the necessary places and helping to expel the Cartel from Cularin? If so, each hero who survived receives 600 xp.

- If the heroes do not complete the mission due to time constraints, but were generally "on the right track," award them v of the total adventure experience.
- If they obtained all the necessary information, but refused to assist in the raid on the Cartel base, award them æ of the total adventure experience.

Note that the amount of roleplaying experience heroes receive is not tied to how far the heroes get in the scenario.

|                            |         |
| -------------------------- | ------- |
| Adventure Experience:      | 600xp   |
| Roleplaying Experience:    | 0-400xp |
| Total Possible Experience: | 1000xp  |

### Loot Summary

Player characters may keep items from the scenario that are listed on the loot list below or which meet the following conditions:

1. The item must be specifically listed in the text of the adventure (e.g. body armor on foes). If it is not listed in the text, the characters cannot keep it. Items of this nature can be sold for 50% of book value, or recorded on a character sheet.
2. Animals, followers, monsters, henchmen, droids, and so forth (any living being, basically) may not be kept from a scenario for any reason unless the treasure summary lists the being specifically. It is okay for the player characters to form relationships with NPCs, but these will not be certed and cannot bring material benefit to the character. Contacts (sources of extra information) must be specifically certed.
3. Theft is against the law, but may be practiced by some player characters. Items worth more than 1000 credits that are of personal significance to the owner (including family heirlooms) will be discovered in the possession of the character by one means or another. The character must return the item and pay a fine equal to three times the value of the item stolen. In addition, the PC caught receives campaign-decided penalties for being known as a thief. For other stolen items which meet the criteria in #1 above, use your judgment and the circumstances within the game to determine whether a PC thief gets away with the theft or not.

Any item retained according to these rules, which does not have a certificate, will not ever have a certificate issued for it.

The campaign staff reserves the right to take away any item or credits acquired for things it later finds unreasonable but which were allowed at the time.

#### Premiere Only, Winter Fantasy 2001

- Baylan's Datapad: Perhaps the most useful slicing tool ever to fall into your hands, this datapad is loaded with a very limited amount of software that can, quite literally, slice almost any system. However, the programs on the pad can only run a limited number of times. In the hands of a competent hero (that is, one with 8 or more ranks in either Computer Use or Disable Device), the programs within this datapad can be activated for a +40 circumstance bonus to any attempt to use the qualifying skill (as noted above; this does not allow individuals with the requisite ranks in computer use to disable devices with the +40 bonus, or vise versa). Heroes with sufficient ranks in both skills can use the pad for either purpose. Heroes with sufficient ranks in neither skill are unable to use the item. The programs within the pad will only function 4 times before the pad goes inert. Any attempt to modify the datapad or otherwise access the programs will result in the pad's self-destruct mechanism being activated, doing damage equivalent to a thermal detonator. [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]

#### From the Cartel Base:

- 1 Aquata Breather per hero (if they find and take them)

#### From the various fights:

- 3 Blaster Pistols
- 2 Blaster Rifles
- 1 Hold-Out Blaster
- Burned-out lightsaber: This lightsaber case, once used by Velin Wir, is completely non-functional and cannot be repaired. However, it makes an excellent decoration, and is indistinguishable from a functioning lightsaber until one tries to ignite it.

#### From the Cities of Gadrin and Hadrett

- 1000 credits per hero
- Certificate of Gratitude: Be it known that the bearer of this certificate has assisted the people of Cularin in a time of great peril. They should be treated with the utmost dignity and respect by any citizen of Gadrin or Hedrett. [Game mechanic effect: This certificate may provide a one-time +10 circumstance bonus to any skill check in which the goal of the hero is to keep from getting into trouble. Once used, it should be voided.]
