title: 'GM Aid #1: Where Everything Is'
---

In the absence of a full map of Cularin, and for your ease in running the module, I have separated out where each locale the heroes can visit is by city (Gadrin or Hedrett), and referenced the encounter/page where that locale may be found in the module. Don't say I never did you any favors. ;-)

| City                                                                    | Locale             | Page # | Associated NPC | NPC to See     |
