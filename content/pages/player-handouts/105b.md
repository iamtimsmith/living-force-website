The Neeva-Beelo is a YT-1210 light freighter. It was the main production light freighter from Corellian Engineering Corporation until recently, when the newer YT-1300 was introduced. The YT-1210 is saucer-shaped - much like the YT-1300, but without the forward mandibles - with its cockpit jutting off the port side (if looking at the front of the ship). Two large sensor booms protrude off the front of the ship - easy targets if someone is attacking the ship.

Teeloo's ship is at least twenty very hard years old. It has definitely seen better days. Who knows what problems lurk beneath its rust-pitted hull only the Maker knows. The only significant modification to the ship was a reduction in the cargo capacity and an increase in the passenger capacity.
