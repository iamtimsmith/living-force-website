_Just another day on the floating city of Tolea Biqua. Rodians. Blood Raptors. Tunnel racing on Eskaron. An adventure for Living Force heroes levels 1 to 6._

## Character Earnings

At the beginning of the round, if the characters are employed, they receive their pay. No matter how much time has passed since the previous round, they receive pay for one week. Characters who are not employed but who have Profession or Craft skills may roll against those skills to see how much they have earned from their profession or craft in the last week. Use the method in the core rules. [Take the number you roll and multiply it by six to get the number of credits earned.]. Note that characters may use only one of the above methods!

When running this adventure, or any Star Wars adventure, keep in mind the Star Wars adventures should seem like the Star Wars movies. The action should flow quickly and the players should not get caught up in too many details of what they are doing. Describe things in sweeping statements, and recall scenes from the movies when necessary to help players visualize what is going on. More than anything else, have fun.

## GM Overview

_The Price of Business_ begins on the floating city of Tolea Biqua. Located in the upper atmosphere of the gas giant Genarius, it is a beautiful mixture of colors at a distance and a nightmare of angles up close. It is also the main gambling hub of the Cularin system. Refer to [GM Aid 1](/gm-aids/105-1) for more detailed information on Genarius and Tolea Biqua.

The heroes are on the floating city for their own reasons: soldiers on leave; scouts, scoundrels and fringers looking for the next job; Jedi Padawan learners experiencing the gamut of culture the city has to offer; nobles looking for that thrill that only the fringe of society can offer. The players are free to decide exactly why their heroes are on Tolea Biqua, as long as it is within reason.

The opening scene of the adventure has the heroes wandering around Tolea Biqua. They are sampling the various fares the city has to offer and may either be together or apart (use your judgment here). Allow them to do some gambling or betting for just a few minutes if they wish.
All the heroes happen to be walking down the same street when a skiff comes flying out of a docking bay. It almost collides with one of the heroes and catches the attention of everyone nearby. Inside the docking bay, a Rodian fringer by the name of Teeloo is getting roughed up by a group of Blood Raptors, a local gang.

Anyone in front of the docking bay can clearly hear the laughter and threats coming from the Raptors and the sounds of Teeloo being hit. Upon investigation, the characters see two Raptors holding Teeloo upright by his arms while a larger Raptor threatens him, then punches him in the stomach. Several other Raptors stand nearby laughing at the Rodian.

The heroes should step in at this point and help poor Teeloo. If they do not do this, Teeloo spots them and looks at them with a pleadingly (think of the sad puppy look). Of course, the Raptors will resent anyone stepping in on their fun and promptly seek to intimidate the heroes into leaving. A fight breaks out if that is not successful.

After sending the Raptors packing, the heroes will discover Teeloo is new to Tolea Biqua and the Cularin system. He just unexpectedly inherited his ship from an uncle and is still "learning the ropes" of being a freighter pilot. He tells the heroes that he accidentally collided with a Blood Raptor ship above Genarius and they came seeking revenge. No matter what he told them, the Raptors felt the collision was on purpose. As a result, they took his cargo (his whole life investment) and forced him into agreeing to race one of them through Eskaron tomorrow.

Teeloo will not immediately ask the heroes for help, hoping they will just volunteer. He is not much of a pilot and needs any help he can get to fly through the treacherous tunnels of the moon. If he loses the race, the Raptors get his ship. If he wins, the Rodian gets his cargo back. Should the heroes not volunteer to help Teeloo, he will ask for their assistance and offer a portion of the profits from selling his cargo.

The second scene includes the heroes and Teeloo's attempts to fix the damage to his ship. Also, a night attack by several Raptors who are determined that Teeloo and his ship will not arrive at the race the next day.

The third scene is the race through the tunnels of Eskaron. The Blood Raptors have picked the tunnel, which is well away from a much larger race being sponsored by Nirama, the crimelord of the Cularin system. The race is neck and neck when the Raptor tells the heroes that whomever makes it out of the moon first gets to determine where the second half of the race takes place: either the asteroid field just beyond Genarius (filled with dangers of collision and pirates) or from Tolea Biqua to the deserted floating city of Nub Saar (potential radiation storms and other perils). The Raptor then pulls just ahead of the heroes and blasts a ship in the other race as he crosses an intersecting tunnel. Both the Raptor and heroes fly though the fireball. Unknown to both parties, this ship has been sponsored by Nirama. He enters the picture later in the scenario.

The fourth scene is the last half of the race. Whomever is the first to exit Eskaron gets to determine which location is the final stage of the race.

The fifth scene occurs when both ships land back at Tolea Biqua, side by side. The Raptors figure on being winners either way, whether or not their racer won the race. Of course, a fight will break out, unless the heroes are very successful in negotiating (or intimidating) an alternative.

Either way, at the end of the scene, representatives of Nirama arrive and "request" that both the heroes and Blood Raptors accompany them. Nirama has granted them an audience.

The final scene happens at one of Nirama's establishments on Tolea Biqua. He asks each side its account of what happened and then separates them to stop the blame-game that ensues. The heroes must make a convincing argument that the Raptors' ship fired on Nirama's racer and destroyed it.

## Player Introduction

The heroes are on Tolea Biqua for a variety of reasons. Soldiers of the Republic may be on leave, while soldiers-for-hire (and scouts) may be looking for their next job. Jedi Padawans may be here at the urging of their masters to experience the gamut of culture that is present on the floating city. Scoundrels and fringers may be looking for the next big score. (NOTE: For safety, Jedi Padawans are advised by their masters to stay together. They may not know each other by name, but have seen each other around the Academy. Since Tolea Biqua is somewhat lawless, harbored aggressions against Jedi may not be restrained here.)

Whatever their reason for being here, the heroes are all enjoying what the floating city has to offer. Tolea Biqua bustles with activity all the time. Gambling houses, bars, and other seedy locales line the streets of the city.

The slapped-together appearance of the buildings adds to the city's unique atmosphere.

Beings outside some of the business try to lure potential victims ... er, customers ... into their establishments. Play this out. Good examples are Toydarians hovering in the air, calling out to beings (especially hero Jedi) to come in and experience what their business has to offer, a Wookiee occasionally just picking someone up and launching them into the building, etc. Ham it up and have some fun here.

The heroes are free to do whatever they wish for a while. Gambling in the various casinos, moving from one bar to the next, looking for a job to earn some credits, and so forth. Do not spend more than approximately twenty minutes of on this portion of the adventure.

In Scene 3, the heroes will have the opportunity to place bets on their race. You may not want to spend as much time here gambling as in that scene.

After an appropriate amount of time has elapsed, proceed to SCENE 1.

## SCENE 1 Rodians and Raptors

The heroes are all walking down one of the streets, looking at what is going on around them. Pick a hero (or two if they are traveling together). They are passing by a docking bay when the following happens:

**_You hear the sound of a repulsor engine rev and, out of the corner of your eye, catch sight of a cargo skiff flying out of a docking bay right next to you._**

Have the hero (or heroes) make a DEX check at DC 10 to jump out of the skiff's path. If the DEX check fails, then the hero is struck for 2D6 damage. As they roll to a stop, the heroes see four figures on the skiff, dressed similarly to each other, laughing and pointing at them as they zoom away. The skiff picks up a little altitude and turns a corner, disappearing from sight.

The figures in the skiff are members of the Blood Raptors gang. They are all dressed in Blood Raptor colors, black synth-hide jackets with a blood-red claw on the back. Heroes can make a _Knowledge: Streetwise_ check at DC 15 to recognize the Raptors. If the hero has _Knowledge: Streetwise-Cularin System_, the DC for the check is 10. A successful roll allows the hero to recognize the gang, as well as the fact they operate primarily on Tolea Biqua and Varna Biqua. The Raptors are nothing but bullies, often preying on visitors to either city.
Once the skiff has disappeared, things return to normal (for Tolea Biqua). The beings on the street go back to their previous activities before the Raptor "show."

The doors of the docking bay are open about half- way, approximately four meters. Any hero standing in front of the bay needs to make a Listen check at DC 10. If successful, they hear a smacking noise followed immediately by a groan.
If they wish to investigate, the heroes can either walk right in or sneak in (opposed Hide vs. Spot checks). Looking in, they bay is easily forty or so meters across. There are a number crates laying around that could be used for cover. The light in this bay is not very bright. Normal vision is unhampered, but there are lots of shadows. Regardless of how they enter the docking bay, the heroes see the following when they enter:

**_Immediately in front of you is a YT-1210 freighter. It is well traveled and could definitely use some repairs. The front of the ship, just beside its sensor boom, has been crushed by an impact of some sort. Rust spots and flaking paint cover the hull. A single laser cannon is mounted on the top._**

**_In front of you, at the ship's boarding ramp, stands a group of beings. A small Rodian is held by two large humans. A third human mutters something at the Rodian and slams his fist into the poor creature's stomach. You hear a whoosh of air from the Rodian, as well as a pain-filled groan._**

**_To your left is another skiff. This one is empty and is hovering about half a meter above the ground. There are three more humans standing against it, watching the entertainment._**

**_All six wear the same jackets as the ones in the other skiff._**

If the heroes do not immediately step in to help Teeloo, he will spot one of them and give them a pleading look (think sad puppy) between blows.

Each of the humans is wearing a blaster pistol strapped to his hip. They do not take kindly to someone interrupting their fun. Their leader, Scar Blenner, will first try to intimidate the heroes into leaving (calling the heroes names, etc. A favorite is to call any Jedi "spoonbenders," Wookiees "rugs," etc. Be creative.). If that is not successful, things will get ugly fast. The Raptors will stay with fists and knives unless the heroes draw blasters, then they will do the same. Regardless of how the fight starts, Scar will signal his people to stop and board the skiff if two Raptors go down or he is severely injured himself.

The heroes are also free to try talking, as long as they have not been intimidated. If the heroes manage to intimidate the Raptors, the gang will board their skiff and leave. Unless it has been destroyed in a lightfight, they will not leave it behind.

Once the confrontation begins, the Raptors drop Teeloo to the ground and forget about him. He lays there moaning and clutching himself in tremendous pain (Teeloo has lost all of his VP and two WP.). Teeloo has no effect on the outcome of the conflict. Whenever it is over, Scar (or one of the other Raptors if Scar is down), looks over at the prone Rodian.

**_"Just remember to be there tomorrow morning. Or else we come back. And it'll hurt more."_**

Once the Blood Raptors have left, Teeloo wheezes out thanks to the heroes. The Rodian is dressed in a worn shirt and pants, with scuffed boots. A series of numbers is written in black across his forehead. It is an effort for him to sit up. If the heroes offer to treat him, Teeloo accepts and invites them aboard his vessel. Otherwise, he tells them he has a medpac aboard his ship and asks their help getting into it. (NOTE: Teeloo speaks Basic with a heavy lisp. This is an excellent roleplaying opportunity.)

The interior of Teeloo's ship looks as bad as the outside. Not only could it use a good scouring, but several rolls of spacer's tape, new wiring, bulkheads and various other components wouldn't hurt either. Any decent spacer or techead can see that even a hydrospanner can't fix all the problems this ship has.

Teeloo invites the heroes into the lounge and motions for everyone to have a seat. There are only enough seats for four besides Teeloo. Others will need to pull up a crate, stand or sit on the floor (which may be safer than the chairs). If the heroes have not medically helped him, the Rodian will pull out a medpac and treat himself. He is very clumsy at this and it is obvious he does not gain much aid from the device.

Once everyone is settled, Teeloo will again thank the heroes.

**_"Thhank you. I dew noth know whath I wouldth have done hadth you noth come along. Losth my thip mosth definthly. Maybe more."_**

### Teeloo's Story

Teeloo arrived from Rodia three days ago. Space travel and piloting are very new to him. He inherited the ship from an uncle, who gave Teeloo the ship just to upset his own children. Teeloo has very little experience flying, having only owned the ship just over a month. His uncle showed Teeloo what he considered the basics of flight and navigation, gave him a small cargo to help him get set up and left the ship. That night, Teeloo heard someone trying to get into the ship. Figuring it to be his very irate cousins, Teeloo blasted into space and searched his nav computer for an out of the way system. Cularin came up, so he inputted the coordinates and jumped into hyperspace. Upon reversion to realspace, his main hyperdrives burned out, stranding him in the Cularin system until they could be repaired or replaced. Teeloo originally intended to get his family (mother, aunt, four brothers, and six sisters) before leaving Rodia and bringing them with him. His sudden departure from Rodia changed that. Now, he just wants to get his ship fixed so he can return to Rodia and get his family before his cousins find them and take out their anger on them. After retrieving his family, Teeloo just wants to find a quiet system and start a business transporting cargo within that system (he hates astrogating).

If asked why the Raptors were attacking him, Teeloo will visibly wince and tell the heroes that on his approach towards Genarius he accidentally collided with one of their ships. He never saw it coming and his sensors never picked anything up. If asked, Teeloo will say he did not scan with his sensors, they tell you automatically, right?

After he hit their ship, Teeloo made for the floating city that would not ask questions (Tolea Biqua) as quickly as he could. He landed yesterday and stayed in his ship until about an hour before the heroes showed up. Afraid that someone might be looking for him, Teeloo did not try to sell his cargo, which consisted of a few animal skins, some Rodian wine ("Besth sthuff in the whole galaxthy."), and various other items. After a day, he had to get moving and offload his cargo. Fees were due on the docking bay and he needed to get his ship fixed ("Uncle never did geth around to thath parth.").

As soon as his finger touched the comm panel in the docking bay, a large hand grabbed his shoulder and spun him around. A gang of humans were standing there, evil smiles on their faces. After a few choice words (and fist blows), the leader of the group declared
Teeloo would load his cargo onto one of their skiffs as payment for the damage done to their ship.

After he finished loading the skiff, two men grabbed him and the large man started giving Teeloo what he called "lessons in courtesy." He told Teeloo that he was a fair man and was going to give the Rodian a chance to get his cargo back. All he had to do was meet him tomorrow morning at these coordinates (points to his forehead) above Eskaron.

There, the two will race through tunnels in the moon to the other side. If Teeloo wins, he gets his cargo back. If he loses, the Raptors keep his cargo and take his ship. If he doesn't show up, they are going to come and take him and his ship.
The Rodian starts to get teary eyed when telling the heroes about the race. It is obvious he does not have the skill to win, much less survive, such an ordeal. If the heroes offer to help (as they should), Teeloo will be ecstatic. He will start gibbering in Rodese (complete nonsense to any hero who speaks the language) before he calms down.

**_"Thhank you, my friendth. I am thruly thumbled by your generothithy. I do noth have much tho offer in rethurn, buth I thall give each of you a porthion of my profith upon our gloriouth victhory."_**

Teeloo tells the heroes that, while the ship looks bad, it works pretty well. The other ship is in much worse shape.
Teeloo allows the heroes to inspect the ship and its systems. Sure enough, it is not in too bad shape, though it looks like bantha pudu.

> **Neeva-Beelo: Craft: Modified CEC YT-1210 Transport;** Class: Transport; Cost: Not available for sale; Size: Small (35m long); Crew: Teeloo (plus 1 gunner to operate the cannon); Passengers: 6; Cargo Capacity: 75 metric tons; Consumables: 1.5 months; Hyperdrive: x2 (backup x16); Maximum Spd: Attack; Defense: 21 (+1 size, +10 armor); Shields: Yeah, right; Hull Points: 115; DR: 10.
>
> **Weapon: Laser cannon;** Fire Arc: Turret; Att Bonus: +3 (+1 size, +2 fire control; cannot be fired from cockpit); Damage: 4d10x2; Range Modifiers: PB +0, S +0, M/L n/a.

The engines, both sublight and hyperdrive, have seen better days. The main hyperdrives are burned out. The backup hyperdrives aren't much better. The gun works, though it can only be fired from the gunner's chair in the turret. Much of the wiring has been rigged, effecting a -4 penalty to work on any computer or electrical system on the ship.

With a successful DC 15 Repair check, the heroes can discern the following systems need repairs:

- The sensors were damaged in the collision, causing a -4 penalty to all Computer Use checks when using them. With several hours of work, a Repair check at DC 15 and a lot of praying, the sensors can be jury-rigged so that the penalty drops to -1.
- The collision also knocked the sublight engines slightly out of alignment (-2 Pilot check penalty to changes in speed). They can be recalibrated with a successful DC 18 Repair check. All that is needed for this job is about six hours and a tool kit, which Teeloo has on board.
- Most of the forward maneuvering thrusters have been damaged. A successful DC 12 Repair check alerts the heroes to this problem. Unless repaired, the ship will be rather sluggish and respond slowly when changing direction or trying to avoid obstacles (-4 penalty to Pilot checks in maneuvering situations. Eight hours of works and a successful DC 16 Repair check will restore about half of the thrusters to working condition, dropping the Pilot penalty to -2).
- The servo-motors that allow the top gun turret to rotate 360-degrees are damaged. Currently, the turret can only cover the right and rear fire arcs. The working servos can be removed and placed so that a different fire arc is covered, but the two arcs must be adjacent (i.e. not left and right or front and back). This requires a successful DC 12 Repair check and two hours of work. The "bad" servos are completely burned out and cannot be repaired. It may be possible to jury-rig a hand crank to allow the turret to be rotated through the two fire arcs with no servos. This requires eight to ten hours of work and a successful DC 20 Repair check. Also, rotating the cannon through one of these fire arcs is a move-equivalent action and the gunner looses the fire control bonus while in that arc.
- The power core has been jarred and is potentially going to fail. A successful DC 20 repair check fixes it for the most part (eight hours of work required), but power fluctuations are still possible.
- Teeloo has no credits to purchase any spare parts for his ship. He does not wish the heroes to use their credits if they offer ("It ith enougth thath you are helping me alreadthy."). If they insist on leaving the docking bay to purchase replacement parts, Teeloo will not try to stop them. If they look around the docking bay and make a DC 15 Search check, enough spare wiring can be found to rig the sensors (as explained above). A few parts can be found in the docking bay with a successful DC 18 Search check.

Ideally, allow only two or three of the above problems to be fixed before the race. This allows for interesting problems to occur while the race is happening and lends a very Star Wars feel to the event.

Once finished, the ship runs as well as can expected without replacing everything with brand new parts. Teeloo seems confident that they will prevail in the race. He offers to let the heroes sleep aboard the ship, giving his cabin to whomever is going to pilot it.

## SCENE 2 Strangers in the Night

After everyone has settled in for a good night's rest, a group of Raptors sneaks into the bay to do a little sabotage. Their intentions are to lob a few grenades at the ship to jar things loose - thus sealing a Blood Raptor victory in the race.

If the heroes have posted a guard, then make opposed Move Silently/Hide and Listen/Spot checks. There are seven Blood Raptors and they have split into two groups. One group of four, which will create the diversion at the entrance to the landing bay and attempt to draw everyone out of the ship, and a group of three who have climbed up onto the rim of the landing bay from outside. The second group intends to drop grenades onto the freighter. They also have a single thermal detonator to really shake things up just before they scratch gravel.
For groups averaging 1st-3rd level heroes:

> **Blood Raptors (7): Male Human Thug 2;** IM +0; Def 10; Spd 10m; WP 15; Att +3 melee (1d4+1, knife), +2 ranged (3d6, blaster pistol), +2 ranged (4d6/2d6, frag grenade), +2 ranged (8d6/4d6, thermal detonator); SV Fort +4, Ref +0, Will +0; CC A; Rep 1; Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 8, Wis 10, Cha 9.
>
> **Equipment:** street clothes, Blood Raptor jacket, blaster pistol, knife (3 of them are armed with 3 frag grenades each. One of the 3 also has a single thermal detonator).
>
> **Skills:** Intimidate +4 Feats: Toughness

For groups averaging 4th-6th level heroes:

> **Blood Raptors (7): Male Human Thug 4;** IM +0; Def 11 (+1 class); Spd 10m; WP 15; Att +6 melee (1d4+2, knife), +4 ranged (3d6, blaster pistol), +4 ranged (4d6/2d6, frag grenade), +4 ranged (8d6/4d6, thermal detonator); SV Fort +5, Ref +1, Will +1; CC B; DSP 1; Rep 2; Str 14, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 8, Wis 10, Cha 9.
>
> **Equipment:** street clothes, Blood Raptor jacket, blaster pistol, knife (3 of them are armed with 3 frag grenades each. One of the 3 also has a single thermal detonator).
>
> **Skills:** Intimidate +6 Feats: Toughness

The trio with the grenades will start things off. Three grenades drop onto the hull and explode. This shakes the ship slightly. The three Raptors will continue until their supply of grenades is exhausted. The Raptor with the thermal detonator will prepare his final weapon and throw it once several of the heroes have left the ship.

The four Raptors at the bay entrance will engage any hero attempting to leave the ship in a lightfight. They all use the entryway as partial cover (one-half cover; +4 cover defense bonus and +2 reflex save bonus), two kneeling down and the other two standing.
Once the grenade droppers see return fire towards their comrades, the Raptor with the thermal detonator throws it at the ship. Landing halfway between the back of the ship and the turret, it explodes and shakes the freighter violently. Everyone in the ship must make a DEX check at DC 12 to stay standing, in their seat or in their bed.

As soon as the thermal explodes, the Raptors bug out. They will attempt to take any of their wounded with them, but not at the risk of their own necks. Should any of the Raptors be captured, they will play it cool and cocky. They were here to make sure their pilot had an edge in the race, nothing else.

The rest of the night passes uneventfully. Proceed to Scene 3.

## SCENE 3 Racing the Tunnels

As the heroes sleep, Teeloo awakes in the morning, having slept in the cockpit. He is full of energy and looking forward to the group's victory today. He pads back to the galley and starts preparing a Rodian breakfast for everyone.

**_Fire! The scent of something burning stirs you from your slumber. Sitting bolt upright, you expect to see smoke filling the ship. Instead, you hear the sizzle and pop of something frying in the direction of the galley._**

Heroes arriving in the galley find Teeloo standing in the middle of a grease fire, coughing and holding onto a pan. Blackened something sits in the pan, fried to a crisp.

Teeloo has prepared a breakfast that does not look good to any species but a Rodian, and even then it is questionable: a blood-red fruit called galma (which smalls faintly like a sweaty bantha); brown vakiir eggs; thick, creamy lime-green kuul milk (heated, of course); and nilluk strips, which are very well cooked and blackened due to the fire). Teeloo insists on everyone eating. This is their victory breakfast. Once the race is finished, Teeloo tells them, they shall feast on a meal usually served only after a large hunt.

After breakfast, it is time for the heroes to fly up to Eskaron for their race. Teeloo is positively giddy at this time.

Before, during or just after breakfast, it is possible for one or more of the heroes to find someone to take a bet on their race. A successful Knowledge: streetwise check at DC 12 allows the heroes to locate an opportunistic individual, in person or via vid panel, that will give them 3 to 1 odds on winning the race. After all, the heroes are unknown and the Blood Raptors are not. The individual will accept up to a 5,000 credit total bet by the party. (So if the heroes win the race, they will receive 15,000 credits if 5,000 credits are bet.)

NOTE: Ideally, one of the heroes should be flying the ship, with Teeloo serving as co-pilot (adding a +2 circumstance bonus to the hero piloting checks). However, if none of the heroes are pilot-types, or do not wish to fly the ship, Teeloo will gladly pilot as long as one of the heroes serves as his co-pilot.

### To the Moon

The trip to the barren moon takes about thirty minutes at cruising speed. Traffic is light at this time, so dodging incoming and outgoing ships is no problem. The heroes may wish to test the various ship systems on their way to the starting point.

Pointing the transport toward the coordinates provided by the Blood Raptors, the heroes get closer to the surface of Eskaron. Numerous tunnels can be easily seen descending into the moon's interior. Anyone looking out of the ship, via cockpit or gun turret, may make a DC12 Spot check to notice about a dozen ships collecting several hundred kilometers away from them, just above Eskaron's surface. They are not in the same area as the heroes will be.

The heroes soon come upon a lone deep red SoroSuub G-59 Cannibalizer (the SoroSuub version of the Z-95 Headhunter). It is positioned several kilometers above a tunnel that is about one hundred meters in diameter. As they get closer to the G-59, a voice comes over the comm system.

**_"Well, I'm impressed you made it, greeny. Never thought that bucket would have got off TB._**

**_"Anyways, it's real simple. The tunnel you're starin' at goes straight through the moon. Roughly. Lots of loops and turns, switchbacks and so forth. So, straight down. First one to the end gets the big prize. Any questions?"_**

The Blood Raptor pilot will be as vague as possible in answering any questions the heroes may come up with. If asked about weapons, he chuckles and promises not to shoot at their ship. The Raptors want it in intact ... mostly. If asked about the other ships, the Raptor replies that someone else must also be racing the tunnels today. It doesn't affect their race. If asked his name, well, that's not really important.

After all questions have been resolved, he announces the race will start in twenty seconds. His engines fire up and he moves to a point about fifteen meters away from the heroes ship. At ten seconds, he verbally counts the seconds down one by one until he reaches zero.

### Racing the Tunnels

The important goal of the race is to keep things interesting and exciting for the heroes. Do not let the range between the two ships to get past Medium (see Starship Ranges Diagram, P. 175 Star Wars Rulebook) either way. Drama and tension are the keys to success here. If the heroes are rolling poorly, fudge the Blood Raptor's roll a little to keep the race exciting (and vice versa).

The Blood Raptor pilot will signal the heroes when they are to begin the ten-second countdown. When it reaches zero, roll initiative (Blood Raptor vs. hero pilot) to see who gets "out of the gate" first. Remember, both ships start at "stop" and must accelerate from there. Gael will use his first action to boost his speed two categories (stop to cruising; DC 15 Pilot check). His second action will increase his speed even more, to attack speed (DC 5 Pilot check).

(NOTE: Gael is familiar with all stages of this course. He need not make sensor checks to know what obstacles or patterns are getting ready to appear. He will use the tunnel and its features to his advantage as much as possible.)

It would be in bad form to directly shoot at each other's ships. Nothing is wrong with using weapons against the tunnel to slow the opposition down. Shooting portions of the tunnel so that debris rains down on an opponent's ship is perfectly okay. Apply a -4 penalty on all attack rolls made this way (the shooter must figure where to shoot to have the best chance of hitting their opponent with the rocks).

If a ship is hit, figure base damage as 4d10x5. The tunnels pieces will be fine (x1/16 multiplier) if laser cannons were used or diminutive (x1/8) if concussion missiles were used.

### The Ship's Condition

Due to various factors, Teeloo's ship is definitely not the ideal racing ship. Previous problems (identified the day before) and recently developed problems (from the Raptor attack) have taken their toll on the old ship. Periodically during the race, at dramatic moments, have some problem occur that demands some of the heroes' attention (sample list below). The reason for this is simple: flying the race is the pilot's job. It is very easily for the pilot to be the only one doing anything during this race. To prevent this and keep the other players interested, problems will happen that need the other heroes attention. Keep in mind there should be some problems from the day before that couldn't be fixed due to time constraints.

Sample Problems:

1. Power loss to one or more systems temporarily. Ex: sensors, laser cannon, communication system. Repair DC 12.
2. Sublight engines malfunction and decrease one or two speed categories. This threatens to be permanent unless immediately fixed. Repair DC 15/18.
3. A small hull breach develops in the cargo bay due to the grenade explosions. The bulkheads automatically seal shut and prevent the heroes from moving about the ship. Computer Use DC 10 to open bulkheads, Repair DC 15 to seal hull.

Feel free to add other problems. The important thing here is to keep the non-piloting players involved and interested.

### Stage One - The Entrance Tunnel

The first portion of the race takes the heroes into a large tunnel, approximately one-hundred meters in diameter. It is relatively smooth with no stalactites or stalagmites. This portion of the tunnel runs for about 3 rounds. The two participants spend their time here jockeying for position. As everyone approaches the next portion of the race, the tunnel begins to narrow until it reaches approximately forty meters in diameter.

_Pilot Checks:_ No hazards here. Normal rules for starship speed, piloting and maneuvering (Star Wars Rulebook, p. 176-7) apply here.

Gael will quickly try to establish the lead in this portion of the race. He will use all available actions to both increase his speed and range between the heroes. He will fly at attack speed unless the heroes push their speed up to ramming, in which case he will also.

### Stage Two - The Spiral

The tunnel, which starts at forty meters in diameter and then fluctuates slightly, has relatively smooth walls
also. The tunnel starts straight, but soon begins gently curving in a spiral-like pattern.

_Pilot Checks:_ Apply all appropriate speed modifiers. Pilots must make a DC 5 (7 if at attack speed, 9 at ramming speed) to maneuver in the tunnel. The spiral is not tight, but does require concentration. While the tunnel is forty meters in diameter, it is somewhat difficult for the ships to pass each other. Treat each ship as an Avoid Hazard maneuver should this be attempted (DC10 Pilot check).

Gael will attempt to push his lead to even greater distance (if he is in front) or catch up to the heroes (if he is behind).

Towards the end of the spiral, if a hero is manning the sensors and scanning ahead of their ship, have them roll a DC 10 Computer Use check to notice the tunnel takes a sharp (90 degree) turns upward. Of course, if Gael is ahead of the heroes at this stage, they will automatically see the turn.

### Stage Three - Sharp Turn

Two possibilities start this stage off: 1. The heroes know about the turn and are prepared for it, or 2. The heroes do not know about it and could be in for a BIG surprise.

If the heroes know about the turn, the base Pilot DC to navigate it successfully is 10 (modified by speed). If the heroes do not know about the turn, anyone in the cockpit can make a DC 12 Spot check (DC 6 Computer Use check for sensor operator) to see the tunnel ends in a sharp upward turn. If they still do not see it, the heroes ram the wall. Figure damage and call in the cleaners.

The tunnel narrows to about thirty-five meters after the turn. The two ships can pass each other, it just gets very difficult. A successful Pilot check of DC 15 is required to pull off the maneuver.

### Stage Four - Skinning the Mynock

This stage involves the tunnel splitting twice into two figure eights. The racers can potentially cross each other two or three times just by following the tunnel.

The tunnel stays about thirty-five to forty meters in diameter. The walls are basically smooth (no obstructions/hazards.)

The pilots approach the first split down a straight tunnel. Sensor operators can detect to split and pattern with a DC 10 Computer Use check. A successful check reveals the split and both branches of the tunnel are roughly the same size and length. If the heroes are behind, this is a good place to break away from Gael and decrease his lead. If the heroes happen to be in front, Gael will attempt to break away into the tunnel opposite the heroes and gain the lead by increasing his speed.

If the ships are traveling the same speed and enter the "tunnel crossing" at the same time, each pilot must make an opposed Pilot roll to avoid each other. Otherwise, describe them as narrowly missing one another as they zip into the next branch.

At the end of the first "8", the tunnel straightens for about fifty meters before splitting into the second "8." The second eight is just like the first except that midway through the first portion, the tunnel narrows suddenly and the pilots must flip their ships 90-degrees to successfully pass through (DC 14 Pilot check).

Due to events in the next stage, have Gael come out of this area ahead of the heroes (You can have each pilot make a Pilot check so the players do not feel cheated by this). The tunnel rejoins and goes on for about three hundred meters before crossing straight through an intersecting tunnel.

Before they cross the tunnel, Gael sends a transmission to the heroes:

**_The voice of the Blood Raptor pilot crackles to life over your intercom. "Not bad so far. We're about halfway through the moon. Final stage of the race is determined by who gets out first. Choices are either through the asteroid field and back again, finishing at Tolea Biqua, or down to Tolea Biqua and then to Nub Saar. Loop around the old city of death and back to TB. Any questions?"_**

The plans have changed (another stage added) because the heroes stepped into some business that wasn't theirs.
Refer to Scene 4 for descriptions of both routes.

### Stage Five - The Incident

Have the sensor operator make a DC 15 Computer Use check. With a successful roll, the operator picks up the tunnel ahead and a number of objects moving through it at high speed. The other objects are starships from the race the heroes may have seen lining up earlier.

Gael also picks the ships on his sensor. Just as he is about to enter the tunnel, the lead ship crosses in front of him. With a deadly collision about to happen, Gael thumbs his blasters and blows the other ship, a Z-95, into a cloud of debris. He blindly flies through the cloud and continues into the tunnel on the other side.

The heroes are close behind him when this happens. The pilot must make a Pilot check at DC 18 to cross the intersecting tunnel safely. If someone is using the sensors and knows where all the other ships are, add a +4 circumstance bonus to the roll. Failure means the heroes did not escape the tunnel without incident: either the wall or another ship has been clipped. This does 1d10x2 damage to the heroes' ship.

When the heroes have re-entered their race tunnel, they are at Medium range from Gael.

### Stage Six - Out of the Frying Pan ...

This portion of the tunnel is free of hazards and not very difficult to maneuver in. The heroes should concentrate on catching up with

Gael. It will take the heroes eight rounds to complete this stage of the race.
A couple of rounds into this tunnel, the heroes comm system intercepts a broad channel signal.
"Markus, I want both of those ships and their crews. Alive and as undamaged as possible. Nirama out."
All the heroes immediately recognize the name Nirama. He is the most influential, and powerful, crimelord in the Cularin system. Now he wants the heroes and Gael.

The tunnel slowly widens out to fifty meters and continues, relatively straight, until it opens into a large cavern.

### Stage Seven - The Cavern of Teeth

Once into the cavern, the heroes see it stretches into darkness to all sides. Sensors show it to be natural, about two hundred meters high, and almost three kilometers long. There are a number of tunnels entering this cavern at various points all around.

Enormous stalactites and stalagmites cover the ceiling and floor of this area. A number of them have formed close enough together to give the image of massive columns dotting the chamber. There is not enough space to fly unobstructed through this cavern. Pilots must make a DC 15 Pilot check to successfully navigate the room.

If Gael is behind the heroes and can't seem to get ahead of them, he will fire off a few blaster shots into the ceiling or stalactites - hoping the falling rock will slow down the heroes. Of course, the heroes can do the same thing if they are behind Gael. (If either Gael or the heroes choose this action, refer to "Running the Tunnels" above for instructions on resolving these attacks.)

### Stage Eight - Zig-Zag

Immediately after exiting the cavern, the heroes enter an unusual area of this racecourse. While not particularly dangerous, this portion requires concentration by the pilot. The tunnel constantly changes direction, left then right, up then right, etc.

There are a total of 12 turns in this section. The hero flying the freighter does not need to make 12 Pilot checks. One or two should be fine. The DC for the Pilot checks is 9. Use your judgment here.

Gael will not try anything really tricky here. The tunnel is just over thirty meters in diameter, not enough room to pass the heroes if he is behind them. Plus, the constant zigzagging of the tunnel makes things that much more difficult.

### Stage Nine - The End

The last portion of the tunnel is basically a straight tunnel. It starts off about 150 meters in diameter and decreases until it is only about thirty meters in diameter when it ends and exits Eskaron.

Gael will use this stage of the tunnel to either increase his lead if he is ahead or attempt to catch the heroes if he is behind. Since this portion is straight, he will accelerate to ramming speed to try and get the advantage.

There are no obstacles here for anyone to encounter, unless someone crashes into the tunnel wall.

Make opposed Pilot checks between Gael and the heroes. First one out of the moon gets to choose the last course of the race.

## SCENE 4 Choices ... and Pirates

The first racer out of Eskaron gets to select the route for the last portion of the race. If Gael is the first pilot out, his selection will be the asteroid field. He figures the heroes are either: 1. just good enough to make it through the field, but will have to take their time so their freighter doesn't get pulverized, or 2. the heroes are not good enough to get through, so they won't even enter the asteroid field and he wins by default.

The heroes may select from either route if they exit Eskaron before Gael.

Unfortunately for both racers, they happen to fly out of the moon and right through a pirate attack. Several pirate vessels have left the cover of the nearby asteroid field and begun attacking a lone freighter. The pirates are in the middle of disabling the ship when the two racers fly through.

The distraction of Gael and the heroes gives the wounded freighter enough time to haul jets from behind the moon and into communication range of Republic forces. The freighter begins sending a signal requesting help to the Republic navy.
Angered by this, the pirates take off after the heroes and Gael no matter which route they take. The pirates are bent on destroying those who cost them their prize.

The pirates will attack until one-third to one-half of their force is destroyed or disabled.

### Scene 4a: The Asteroid Field

If the race should proceed into the asteroid field, things will get very tricky. Asteroids of all sizes fly about in random paths. The necessary DC for Pilot checks are listed below and depend upon the size of asteroid encountered.

| Asteroid Size       | DC  |
| ------------------- | --- |
| Tiny, Small, Medium | 10  |
| Diminutive, Large   | 15  |
| Huge                | 20  |

The racers must make three successful Pilot checks at various DC's to successfully get through the asteroid field (and another three to get back). If things are going well for the heroes, give them some higher DC asteroid encounters. If things are not going so well, give them a break and throw lower DC asteroids in their path.

Remember, the pirates will also pursue both racers into the asteroid field. As their base is located somewhere in here, they are used to dodging the asteroids. The pirates think nothing of attacking someone while skipping around the flying rocks.

Once the racers have gone through the field and returned, nothing is left but a flat out race back to Tolea Biqua.

### Scene 4b: Race To Nub Saar

The second option is racing back to Tolea Biqua and then to the deserted floating city of Nub Saar and back. While it sounds like the easiest of the two choices, there are several dangers present.

Nub Saar was the first floating city to be built over Genarius. Constructed in one of the middle layers of Genarius' atmosphere, it was not occupied very long before terrible radiation storms drove many of the inhabitants away, killed the others and reduced the city to a mere specter of what it once was.

To this day, these storms continue to ravage the abandoned city. Flying in the area is risky at best. Air currents can be difficult to maneuver in. Nuclear- powered storms can erupt suddenly, throwing massive winds and radiation around.

As if the possibility of these storms isn't enough, Genarius's atmosphere offers other dangers. Energy harvesters fly around collecting the planet's atmosphere for the energy stored there. Graceful cochlera float along on the currents. The only life native to Genarius, they are translucent creatures that resemble jellyfish. Their bodies are about three meters in diameter with tentacles reaching from ten to twenty meters in length, depending on their age.

The pirates will also pursue the racers, adding their laser fire to the other dangers offered by Genarius.

As they streak down into Genarius' atmosphere, the wind currents will strengthen. Four Pilot checks at DC 12 (modified by below) will be required to keep control of the craft in the buffeting winds and reach Tolea Biqua.

As the racers are flying, roll 1d6 just before each Pilot check. The following happens based on that roll:

- If you roll a 1: the ship is struck by a cochlera. A
  +5 penalty is added to the Pilot DC to keep control of the ship. Re-roll the d6. If it comes up either 1 or 2, the cochlera has smeared itself on the cockpit viewport. Visibility is reduced for the next 5 minutes (+5 to DC for any checks).
- If you roll a 2: An energy harvester streaks out of a bank of high-energy clouds. Each ship must make opposed Pilot checks to avoid hitting each other (Harvester pilot has Piloting +4).
- If you roll a 3, 4 or 5: Nothing unusual occurs.
- If you roll a 6: The winds pick up momentarily,
  adding +5 to the DC to keep control of the ship.

Immediately after the second Pilot check, the heroes pick up a large storm beginning to form around Nub Saar. They have maybe two minutes before it reaches an intensity that will be life-threatening if they attempt to fly through it.

Gael immediately goes full throttle for the abandoned city, regardless of whether he is in front of the heroes or behind them. His shields powered to maximum, Gael figures he can weather the storm a little better than the heroes, who have no shields.

If there are any pirates left at this point, they haul jets back into space. They have no intention of trying to fly through a radiation storm.

From the time the storm is picked up by the sensors, the heroes have two minutes to loop around Nub Saar. Any longer than that and they will be caught by the storm. The radiation will kill the ship's systems and its inhabitants.

As long as the hero pilot makes his next two Pilot checks, they will make it around the city before the storm can gather its strength to be lethal. If either check is successful by 5 points or more, they shave a little time off the run and get around the city a bit quicker. If either check is failed, the storm will put enough radiation into the ship to damage it (6d6 damage) and the heroes. Heroes will need to make a Fort save at DC 14. A successful save means they take only 1d4 VP damage from the radiation. Failure means they take 2d4 VP damage. Gael must make these rolls also.

Once around Nub Saar, three DC 12 Pilot checks will bring them back to Tolea Biqua. Roll 1d6 with each check as above.
The only thing left is to see who gets there first.

It is very important to be as visually descriptive as possible in this scene. Try to build tension as they penetrate into Genarius' middle atmosphere and approach Nub Saar. The sight of a building storm should create anxiety - describe the storm.

## SCENE 5 Home Is Where the Raptors Are

The heroes are not using the same landing pad as Gael upon arriving back at Tolea Biqua. The heroes will return to the same pad Teeloo was using before the race. The Blood Raptors have secured a landing pad close by.
Whether the heroes win or not, the Blood Raptors have no intentions of giving Teeloo his cargo back. In fact, they are going to try and take his ship as well.

The Blood Raptors will wait for about fifteen minutes after the heroes have landed before they visit the heroes' landing bay. Scar and seven other Blood Raptors walk into the landing bay, ready to do business their way (If the heroes killed Scar in Scene 1, the leading Raptor's name is Vhell Kursoc. His stats are identical to Scar's). Each has a blaster pistol strapped to one leg and a knife to the other.
As they enter the landing bay, the Raptors fan out in a rough semi-circle with Scar in the middle. Their fingers dangle very close to their blasters.

If the heroes do not come out and meet him upon his arrival, Scar gives them another ten minutes before attempting anything. He berates them and their honor the whole time. Scar has no desire to go aboard the heroes' ship, especially if the Blood Raptor pilot was defeated. He will strongly decline any request from the heroes to board their ship.

Scar will inform the heroes of the fact that the Raptors are going to keep Teeloo's cargo and take his ship in exchange for the damage to their ship and trouble that he has caused since then. The heroes can either do this the easy way, or the hard way.

When the situation reaches the point where violence is about to start, read the following:

**_You hear the scream of repulsor engines. Looking up, you see a Z-95 Headhunter appear above the landing bay. The raven black ship hovers menacingly above the bay, weapons pointing down at you._**

**_"Ahem," says a voice from behind you." I think we need to talk."_**

Len Markus, one of Nirama's most prominent henchmen, is standing in the entry to the landing bay. Len is just under two meters tall and very thin. He is very pale, almost albino-like. Len has a blaster pistol strapped to his hip and is dressed in a dark flight suit with jacket.

Eight toughs stand behind him, blaster carbines held ready. Five of them are human, two Trandoshans, and a Twi'lek.

If any of the heroes have previously met Len, he will greet them by name. Other than that, he will not acknowledge them any further.

Then, with a lopsided smile, he continues:

**_"Lord Nirama wishes to see you. ALL of you. Something about, let's see, blowing up one of his racers."_**

**_Motioning towards the entry ramp of your ship,"Shall we go?"_**

Everyone should realize that Len is nicely ordering them to come with him to Nirama. If they do not, or are adamant about not going, Len will give them one more chance. Should they still decide not to go, he motions for one of his men to shoot the troublemaker.

**_One of the Blood Raptors looks at Len and his men. "I ain't goin' anywhere with you," he sneers," Lord Nirama can kiss ..."_**

**_Before the Raptor finishes his sentence, Len gestures and two blaster shots from his men burn into the man's chest. He falls to the landing bay floor, smoke curling up from his jacket._**

**_"He chose ... poorly," Len remarks dryly," I trust you will be much wiser, yes?"_**

Teeloo and the heroes are led aboard the ship ahead of the Blood Raptors. Len's toughs keep the two groups separated. Len will ask the heroes whose ship this is and the ask Teeloo to come with him to the bridge. The toughs collect everyone's weapons. If any of the heroes tries to hide a weapon, make Spot checks for the goons to notice (DC 5 for obvious weapons such as holstered blasters, DC 12 for not so obvious weapons like knives or lightsabers, DC 15 for small weapons like hold-out blasters).

Shortly after, the heroes feel the sublights power up and the ship lifts off. If asked about their destination, none of the toughs will say anything other than they will be at Nirama's shortly... and none of them should be in a hurry to get there (evil chuckling). Len's men quit talking when he reappears from the bridge. Approaching the heroes, he will make small talk with
them. If asked what Nirama plans on doing with them, Len shrugs and replies that he really doesn't know. No one has destroyed one of Nirama's racers before under these circumstances. He will then go into a speech about all the possibilities of what Nirama may or may not do. Be creative. Scare them. However, while they are being scared, given them Knowledge: Streetwise checks (DC 15) to realize that Nirama is not one to act rashly. He considers his options very carefully before dispensing punishment.

## SCENE 6 Meeting Nirama

Len is taking the group to Nirama's residence in Mikish on Cularin. The flight is uneventful and takes about two hours.
When they land and exit the ship, the heroes find themselves on a platform city near some mountains. Len quickly escorts everyone inside a building and through its hallways. Stopping before a pair of carved wooden doors, he smiles and opens them.

**_The doors open to reveal a richly appointed office. Lush carpet covers the floor, carvings and art fill the room. A massive wooden desk sits on the other side of the room, between you and ... something._**

**_Standing with its back to you, and looking out a large window, is a being about Len's height. Its hairless head is covered with bright pink flesh. A rear- facing arm on the creature's left side is absently twirling a blaster._**

**_Len Markus approaches the creature and whispers in its ear. Len backs away as the creature turns slowly face you._**

The creature is rather ugly by most standards. Nirama has a bright pink face. Two pairs of eyes sit atop each other. The upper pair are grayish-blue; the lower pair solid black. He has three arms: one on the right side, two on the left. One of his left arms points forward, the other backward. In his backward hand, Nirama is twirling a blaster pistol. Cocking his head and staring at each group, he sizes them up like a predator.

(NOTE: It is possible the heroes have encountered Nirama before. If he has met them, Nirama will at no time during this meeting acknowledge this. If he owes any favor to the heroes, he will not acknowledge it, nor discuss it. He is all business. If the heroes push it, Len sternly gives them a "you are walking on a very thin rope" look.)

**_"So, you are the ones who destroyed my racer. One of my favorites, yes? You have not only cost me a ship and pilot, but credits. I also lost my temper in front of some very dear friends AND business associates. I do not like doing that._**

**_"Please, tell me who blew up poor Arraxx?"_**

If the heroes looked perplexed, Nirama adds that Arraxx was his racer pilot.

The Blood Raptors immediately launch into a tirade blaming Teeloo and the heroes. They try to out- talk the heroes.
Nirama raises his right hand for silence. He walks to another large window on the right side of the room, which overlooks the forest. Staring out the window, with his twirling blaster pistol facing the two groups, he slowly instructs each group to tell their story, starting with the heroes.

Once each side has told its story, Nirama has Len take them to separate rooms while he decides what to do. If the any of the heroes mentioned Nirama owing them a favor, Len reprimands him for doing so. That is not the way to conduct business with Nirama. He has a long memory, and does not forget debts. Such things will be taken into account as appropriate.

A little while later, Len returns and escorts Teeloo and the heroes back to Nirama's office. The crimelord has not moved from in front of the window. The Blood Raptors are not to be seen.

**_"I have thought much about this. I know you did not fire the shots that destroyed my racer._**

**_"However, you were present. Your participation in that race did directly lead to the destruction of my ship and pilot, along with a substantial monetary loss. If you had not been in that race, my pilot would not have died._**

**_"Thus, I must hold you partially responsible. I think of myself as very fair. Regardless, you will wind up better off than the others."_**

**_Nirama turns to look at each of you, his four eyes penetrating deeply. "You each owe me. A... favor. Something... appropriate. That is all."_**

Len motions everyone out of the room. As the heroes are walking out, Nirama asks Captain Teeloo to remain behind. The little Rodian has quite a frightened look on his face as the doors swing shut.

Len will tell the heroes that Teeloo will be fine ... he thinks. Nirama got most of his anger out earlier, so the Rodian should be okay.
He motions for them to take their weapons from the box, and the other weapons also as "the Raptors will not be needing them." Len then escorts the heroes back to their ship and tells them they are free to leave whenever Teeloo joins them.

Teeloo boards the ship about twenty minutes later. He looks to be in good spirits.

**_"Thank you, my friendth. I am mosth grathful for your help. Lord Nirama has been mosth gracious. He has offeredth me a job flying for him. Andth he is going to fixth my thip. I am thorry I do noth have anything tho pay you with, but I will thertainly pay you out of the profits from my firtht venthure. If there is ever anything I can do for you, leth me know."_**

Unless the heroes wish to stay here in Mikish, Teeloo will fly everyone back to Tolea Biqua.

## FINAL CUTSCENE

**_"And for our final story," the female news anchor announces," Early this morning, workers at the Bollin Exotic Animal Emporium discovered a disturbing sight. Some time last night, after the Emporium had closed, someone who had remained in the zoo fell into the rancor exhibit."_**

**_The view switches from the blonde human reporter to just outside of the rancor cage at the Emporium._**

**_Her voice continues. "The identity of the individual is unknown and authorities have begun an investigation. However, due to the voracious appetite of the rancor, very little evidence was left behind."_**

**_The camera zooms in on a piece of cloth caught on a bush. A scrap of cloth from a Blood Raptor jacket._**

**_"That's the news for this hour. Vell Narot reporting for CSN. Have a nice day."_**

**END OF CUTSCENE**

**THE END**

## Conclusion

### Experience Point Summary

Experience is calculated as follows for Living Force events.

1. Experience awards in the SWRPG are not made for achieving objectives, but instead for successfully completing an adventure of a given length. Thus, if the heroes survived and accomplished the primary goal of the adventure, they receive full Adventure Experience (600 xp for core LF plot scenarios, 350 for non-core LF scenarios).
2. Assign discretionary role-playing experience (0- 300 points). These should reward accurate character portrayal throughout the adventure, not just how well the PC interacted socially. Do NOT automatically award max roleplaying XP, consider carefully how well the players stayed in-character. This is your opportunity to reward appropriately cinematic behavior, so use it!

### Adventure Experience Award:

Did the heroes assist Teeloo and successfully avoid being killed by Nirama? If so, each hero who survived receives 350 xp.
Blood Raptors
6 blaster pistols 6 knives

|                            |         |
| -------------------------- | ------- |
| Adventure Experience:      | 350xp   |
| Roleplaying Experience:    | 0-300xp |
| Total Possible Experience: | 650xp   |

If the heroes did not complete the scenario because of time constraints, but were "on the right track," you may award s adventure experience. If the heroes succeeded in assisting Teeloo, but severely agitated Nirama (it's bad to upset the reigning crime lord for the system), award them æ adventure experience.

### Treasure Summary

Player characters may keep any standard items (found in the Star Wars Core Rulebook and allowed for PC purchase) from the scenario, such as blaster pistols, knives, etc.

#### Race Winnings:

If the heroes placed any bets on their race with the Blood Raptors, they split the winnings amongst themselves.
Teeloo's Payoff: Two adventures from this one, the heroes receive a package from Teeloo. It contains a note of thanks and a credit chip with 1d6x100 (rolled by GM) on it. This payoff arrives at the beginning of the scenario.

#### Debt to Nirama:

The heroes owe a debt to the crimelord. The repayment of this debt will be commensurate with the trouble the hero caused Nirama in contributing to the loss of his pilot, Arraxx, in the races on Eskaron.

#### Teeloo's Gratitude:

Teeloo is grateful to the heroes for their help. He tells them if they ever need a ship to get from one point to another with the Cularin system or from the Cularin system to another system, give him a call (Three Uses for intra-system travel or Single Use for system to system travel). Note: It will usually take Teeloo six hours to finish his current business and get to the heroes. Roll 1d10, on a 1 or 2 he is tied up with a job for Nirama and cannot get away for at least 24 hours.
