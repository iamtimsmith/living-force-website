## DM Overview

In Episode I of the "Eye of the Sun" trilogy, "The Cularin Presence," the heroes discovered an elaborate Metatheran Cartel operation a few kilometers into the lush Cularin rainforests outside of Gadrin. They also discovered a pirate operation not too far from the Cartel's base of operations, where all manner of stolen goods had been taken, but not everything that was missing was found there. Some things ñ particularly high-end computer components ñ were missing from the pirates' inventory.

The people of Cularin have never been particularly trusting of outside trading concerns, and the Cartel has not made its intentions a secret. With a long history of resource plundering, the Cartel looks set up to strip Cularin of her lush beauty, and the clandestine manner in which they established themselves in the jungles has set up an air of mistrust in the community. The Cartel doesn't seem to have any plans for leaving.

Within a week of the Cartel's jungle headquarters being found, people begin disappearing from Gadrin and Hedrett, the two major non-native settlements on the planet. There is no foul play involved, these are simply individuals who don't want the kind of change the Cartel threatens to bring to the system. So they have left their homes and headed off into the jungle to form a resistance group to fight the Cartel, if it comes to that. It is up to the heroes to discover what is going on, and find the lost citizens of Cularin.

<p class="h4">Encounter 1: Your Reputation Precedes You</p>
The heroes, having successfully discovered the Cartel's base of operations in the jungle, are summoned one week later by E1-6RA, the droid overseer of the Jedi academy on Almas. E1-6RA has been sent by her master, Lanius Qel'Bertuk, to discover the source of a disturbance in the force on Cularin, but is too well-known to do a great deal of investigating on her own. She provides the heroes with several names (relatively well-known individuals ñ i.e., high Reputation scores) of people who have disappeared and businesses that are suffering because of a lack of personnel, and asks the heroes to report back to her in three days time with whatever they've learned.

<p class="h4">Encounter 2: Overwhelmed, Understaffed</p>
Investigating the affected businesses, the heroes can find that several warehouses lost large numbers of employees over the last week. Two, in fact, lost entire shifts of people who simply stopped showing up for work on the same day. It looks like something organized is going on. Tarasin employees at the warehouses are nervous, and speculate that maybe their former co-workers have fled into the jungle, although they aren't sure why.

<p class="h4">Encounter 3: Families, Friends, and Financiers</p>
Visiting close acquaintances of some of the individuals who have gone missing, the heroes are able to uncover information pointing more directly to organized, if hastily-designed, plans. Unfortunately, their questioning attracts the attention of collection agents for Polst, a malformed human and minor loan shark who is owed money (gambling debts) by one of the missing individuals.

<p class="h4">Encounter 4: The Hiironi</p>
Based on information gathered in the previous two encounters, the best source of information on where the missing individuals may have gone should be the Hiironi irstadt, the largest Tarasin settlement on Cularin. The heroes can make their way to the village with little difficulty and are allowed a meeting with the Mother of the Hiironi, Dariana. She is aware of a great many presences in the jungles of Cularin, but the most recent is an influx of people to the mines beneath Cloud Mountain.

<p class="h4">Encounter 5: Cloud Mines</p>
The only way into the mines of Cloud Mountain involves using the turbocarts, modified speeders that run on magnetic tracks to take miners deep into the mountain. The mines, however, are guarded by droid security forces that will come after the heroes once they begin their descent in the turbocarts, leading to a high-speed battle as the turbocarts rush into the heart of the mountain.

<p class="h4">Encounter 6: None May Pass</p>
A series of traps has been laid at the bottom of the mine- shaft, along with some natural obstacles that the heroes must use their ingenuity and skills to overcome. The encounter culminates with an interview in a large cavern, where the heroes are given a chance to make a case for being allowed further. Assiduous information gathering earlier in the event will pay off, as a code word ("Ravi") could have been uncovered which will allow the heroes access to the area where the resistance is growing without further delay.

<p class="h4">Encounter 7: The Resistance</p>
The heroes are introduced to the leader of the resistance, a woman of middle years named Gerta. She greets them formally, and answers their questions with quiet concern. She will assure the heroes that the resistance presents no threat to the people of Cularin, they are simply a group of concerned individuals who felt the need to mobilize and prepare for the worst, if the Cartel is going to push matters further than they already have. They have substantial evidence that the Cartel is actually behind the pirates, but the money trail has dried up and they can't make the final linkages. Soon, though, they are planning to do something about it. The heroes will then be faced with the decision of whether they will report everything they know back to E1-6RA, which will determine how things will work in Episode III: Revelation and Refutation.

**Important Note to Judges:** Playtests indicated that an overabundance of roleplaying will cause this event to run long. This is NOT to say that you should limit your players, but if they're going off on a wild tangent that has nothing to do with the module, remember that you've only got a 4 hour slot. As you read through the scenario, you will note that past a certain point, if the heroes have gained all the available information from a set of matrix-like sub-encounters, there is no reason for them to keep exploring. It's all right to encourage them to move on by removing NPCs or by simply leading them to burned-out buildings where homes should have been. Use your judgment, but once they have all the information they need, encourage them to move on.

> ### Opening Crawl
>
> In the wake of the discovery of the Metatheran Cartel's base of operations in the jungles of Cularin, and the removal of the nearby pirates, things began looking up. The Cartel embraced the community, offering promises of peace and support. And for the most part, the community returned the embrace. For a few days, everything seemed fine, but then things began to change yet again.
>
> It began slowly, one or two people disappearing, leaving for work in the morning and not coming home that night, or the next, and then the problem spread to entire work teams. Something is clearly wrong, and in a week that's already seen more strangeness than most years on Cularin, the people are getting uneasy. And for the Cartel, it's business as usual

## Encounter 1: Your Reputation Precedes You

_Key ideas of this encounter: introduce E1-6RA, droid overseer of the Jedi academy of Almas; recruit the heroes to help her gather information about the disappearances; give them several leads to explore_

> _**Perhaps it was your newfound, if short-lived, fame from recent excursions into the Cularin jungle, or perhaps it was something else entirely. But you couldn't be surprised when the gray protocol droid appeared at your quarters this morning. Just one more bit of strangeness to add to the growing list. Still, you didn't expect to see what you did when the droid activated its mini-holoprojector.**_
>
> _**The four-armed protocol droid that hung in the area before you, speaking YOUR name, could not be anyone other than E1-6RA, the droid overseer of the Jedi academy on Almas! She wanted you to attend her at noon, at the Jedi enclave on the northeast corner of Gadrin.**_
>
> _**In spite of any reservations you might have had, then, you arrived at the appointed time and were escorted by a young boy into a large, well-lit sitting room just off the central meditation chamber. Upon entering the room you saw no sign of E1-6RA, although there were several other individuals present**_

The other individuals are, of course, the rest of the party. Go ahead and give players a chance to introduce themselves, describe their characters, and speculate on why E1-6RA might have summoned them. They have the information from the opening crawl, as well as any information they might have garnered had they played "A Cularin Presence," but that is all.

After a few minutes, E1-6RA will make her entrance.

> _**The door to the central meditation chamber slides silently open and a familiar droid steps through. She would look like a standard protocol droid if not for her bronze finish and one other distinguishing characteristic ñ the extra set of arms that extend from sockets just above her waist. The lower pair of arms each end not in a hand, but in a flat circular face, about six inches in diameter and covered with tool mounts.**_
>
> _**She moves fluidly, almost gracefully, with little of the awkwardness of standard droid motion. There is something almost human about her walk.**_

This is, of course, E1-6RA. When playing her, it may be easiest to imagine her as C-3P0's slightly less stuffy
sister. She has the same stiff speech patterns, but will sometimes attempt humor at inappropriate moments. The jokes are nearly always awful. She is also in nearly constant communication with Lanius Qel'Bertuk. She is typically referred to as E1 or E16 by anyone who is not Lanius.

> **E1-6RA: Walking droid Expert 9;** IM +0; Def 13; Spd 8 m; WP 12; Atk +6/+1 melee; SV Fort +6, Ref +5, Will +7; SZ M; Rep 5; Str 10, Dex 10, Con 13, Int 16, Wis 12, Cha 8.
>
> **Equipment:** two extra arms with tool mounts, vocabulator, comlink, alien telepathic receiver unit, improved sensor package, heuristic processor, locked access, motion sensors, translator unit (DC 30), recording unit (audio)
>
> **Skills:** Computer Use +11, Diplomacy +0, Disable Device +11, Gather Information +2, Knowledge (Cularin system) +15, Knowledge (galactic politics) +7, Knowledge (Jedi lore) +13, Knowledge (physics) +7, Knowledge (security codes) +7, Listen +11, Read/write Basic, Repair +10, Search +11, Speak Basic, Speak Tarasinese, Spot +13, Treat Injury +3.
>
> **Feats:** Cautious, Great Fortitude, Lightning Reflexes, Sharp-eyed

> _**"Welcome." She takes a seat in a rather spindly- looking chair, adjusting until she looks comfortable, then swivels her head slowly to look at each of you in turn. "I am E1-6RA, personal assistant to Lanius Qel'Bertuk, Jedi Master of the Almas Jedi academy, and his overseer of activities. I believe I know each of you."**_
>
> _**She will then speak to each hero in turn (it is important for her to demonstrate knowledge of their names), saying something like, "Ah, the resourceful Captain Solo, it is truly a pleasure to meet you," or, "The mighty Chewbacca, I've heard of your prowess" or some such. Such matters of, well, protocol, are pretty important to her, as are they to Lanius, so make sure to greet each hero with both their name and a compliment suited to their class. (I would recommend asking the players for three adjectives to describe their characters before the slot begins, and using one of those in her greeting.) Any students at the Jedi academy she will greet with a formal nod as well, and an admonition that they make sure to not allow their studies to suffer while they work on other things. Once the greetings are completed, E1-6RA will get right down to business.**_
>
> _**"I will be short, because time may be short. We have had an alarming number of citizens disappear from Gadrin and Hedrett in the last week. Master Lanius has sensed a disturbance in the Force, emanating from Cularin, but we are too well known to be effective investigators. You, however, have shown yourselves to be capable of great bravery, and are still likely to be able to gather a great deal of information. I believe Master Lanius would consider it a personal favor if you would undertake to learn what you can about the situation."**_

E1-6RA can tell the heroes the following things:

- The disappearances did not begin until after the Cartel's base in the jungle was discovered and the pirates were removed.
- We are not certain whether the Cartel is involved.
- We are not certain whether the pirates are involved.
- The pirates are not affiliated with the smugglers' guild here in the system.
- We have not found any bodies.
- Individuals of many different species have disappeared.
- Many of the missing individuals worked together.
- Yes, we do have a listing of places of business that have been hit hard by the disappearances. [JUDGE NOTE: This is [Player Handout A](/player-handouts/10a), and should end up in the hands of the players by the end of the encounter!]
- We also have a list of names for some of the individuals who are missing, but not all. [[Player Handout B]](/player-handouts/10b)
- As near as we can tell, there are fifty missing citizens as of last night. There will probably be more tonight.

Once the heroes have asked all the questions E1-6RA can reasonably answer she will thank them and ask them to report in to her, at this location, in three days. She will also give them a comlink channel on which she can be contacted if they need to speak to her before then, but three days is when she will be back on-planet.

## Encounter 2: Overwhelmed, Understaffed

_Key ideas of this encounter: visit several workplaces where missing individuals have been employed; gather information about the pattern of disappearances_

Several options are available to heroes, in terms of what they elect to investigate. They can visit some or all of these places of business, although it may be at your discretion whether they can do everything in this encounter and still finish the slot in a timely fashion. Fortunately, not all of the options provide opportunities for detailed information gathering or roleplaying.

### Gungan Security

NOTE TO JUDGES: Not **_all_** Gungans are Jar Jar Binks. While they will be WRITTEN in the pidgin dialect of basic that Jar Jar and his brethren made famous, they do not exist solely for comic relief. Remember, this is Star Wars, where the farm boy can save the galaxy. The potential for heroism is present in all of us, so PLEASE do not use Gungans just as goofy, laughable NPCs. Sure, there are plenty of those around, but there are also Gungans out there who are heroic on purpose.

Gungan Security is a private, for-hire security firm not associated with any single trading house in the system. They have a reputation for quiet competence, although for some reason, they are not always taken seriously by lay persons. Enough employers take them seriously, however, that Gungan Security is a thriving business with multiple clients at any given time.

> _**The offices of Gungan Security are located in the building beside a recently vacated Metatheran Cartel warehouse. The trim around the white face of the building has been polished to a high shine, and the front door stands open. Above the door hangs an ornate neon sign depicting a Gungan wielding a heavy blaster. Above his head float the words, "Gungan Security," while below him the sign reads, "Yousa not safe? Wesa tinken' dat's bombad!" Inside, behind a desk covered with very orderly piles of paper, sits a Gungan of middle years, nervously chewing the tip of his right ear. He looks up as you enter.**_
>
> _**"Yousa welcome!" He spits his ear out and shakes his head. "Yousa comen in now?" He gestures toward several chairs across from his desk, smiling broadly. As you approach, you can see from the red in his eyes that he probably hasn't slept in some time "Meesa Aervis Wint. Who yousa?"**_

Let the heroes briefly introduce themselves. Aervis won't recognize any of them, unless there is a Gungan in the party. He doesn't get out much, but tries to know about which of his fellow Gungans have settled on Cularin.

When asked, Aervis can tell the heroes the following about the disappearances.

- Wesa lost twelve Gungans. Two nights ago, just stopped coming.
- All of the same shift.
- Worken for Broof Yurdel. Hesa big Gungan hero. Hesa gone too.
- Not sure how wesa ganna keep worken. Losen da whole shift, tis a bombad thing.
- Broof? Hesa lived with hissen lifemate over by da river.
- Nope, no signs of fighten here. If dere was fighten, ussen been cleanen up dead Gungan enemies!
- Deysa just went away. Did da logs and everything before theysa left da shift.
- Deysa not worken for any clients. Just bein here on call. No logs sayen dey got hired out, just gone.
- If yousa find dem, tell dem deysa needen to get back to work!

This is all Aervis knows.

### House Hirskaala

> _**House Hirskaala is located near the center of Gadrin, within sight of the statue of Reidi Artom. A thick metal wall surrounds the House Hirskaala compound, and two human guards stand beside the enormous set of double-blast doors that serve as a gate.**_

Heroes who played "A Cularin Presence" should have been here before, and in fact have met Nim'Ri, the head of security for House Hirskaala who has gone missing.

His temporary replacement, a frazzled young human with a penchant for biting his fingernails, by the name of Yaeger Doru, has no idea what happened to Nim'Ri, but will provide one strange piece of information. A single sheet of paper he found under Nim'Ri's desk (Player Handout C), in Nim'Ri's handwriting. In addition to Nim'Ri, seven members of the security force disappeared. This was two nights ago (yes, the same night that the Gungans disappeared).

#### Spirited Spirits

Yves Arsen, the Cerean owner of Spirited Spirits (located across the river in Hedrett), has no time to talk to the heroes. The only employee of note that he's had go missing is Shayne Gerarre, but that's enough. If pressed, most of his stockboys also disappeared, but he doesn't miss them like he misses Shayne's ability to mix drinks. He'll refer the heroes to Shayne's home, and provide them directions.

#### Dry Goods Emporium

The Dry Goods Emporium is also located in Hedrett, along with the Jax Warehouse. Both buildings are visible along the bank of the river from Gadrin, however.

> _**The Dry Goods Emporium is an expansive building that takes up nearly fifty meters of riverfront property. The metal is expertly worked and finished a deep, rustic red-brown that makes the structure look like it had been constructed out of the very wood fow which Cularin is famous. It's an impressive sight, and one you won't see almost anywhere else in the galaxy unless wooden buildings suddenly come into style.**_

The front door to the Emporium is made of glass, set in the same woodeny metal that the rest of the building has been constructed to resemble. Now, we're not talking a faux log cabin here. Think of it more as really expensive, detailed siding, complete with knotholes.

It's a slow day inside the Emporium. The manager, Cal Majjer, is a grizzled old human who scowls a great deal, and he has several Caarite stockboys working for him. It is somewhat odd to see Caarites working for non-Cartel companies, particularly in this sector, but if questioned the stockboys (who are all very young ñ human equivalent of 14 or 15) will explain that they are not allowed to work for the Cartel until they have developed a strong work ethic, and that "Mr. Majjer" (they will never refer to him as anything else) has a reputation even among the Cartel for instilling a good work ethic.

Majjer himself is a pretty stereotypic grumpy old man, who is used to having his way. Right now he's even more grumpy than usual, since Nyrkar, _**"My wookiee in charge of food preservation and dietary consultation, done took off."**_ He hasn't lost any other employees, but if questioned will admit that he said he had lost several more, just to get someone to help him out. He'll also become indignant if the heroes take him to task for lying, since _**"Losing my Wookiee's bad enough to set the company back thousands of credits. It don't matter if there were 200 others gone missing, he's the one what matters."**_

He won't be difficult on purpose, but he really is in a bad mood, doesn't know what to do without Nyrkar (whom he always refers to as "my Wookiee" although there is no ownership or even indentured servitude involved), and has a lot of work ahead of him, so he can't talk to the heroes much and won't provide information beyond what is listed above.

#### Jax Warehouse

The Jax Warehouse is located two blocks up from the Dry Goods Emporium. While it has a reputation for being clean and safe, it really looks like neither as the heroes approach.

> _**The face of the Jax Warehouse building is covered with colorful graffiti, criss-crossed with red and white lines that converge on two brilliant blue-white stars and three paler blue stars scattered across the mural. In the center of the mural is what can only be Morasil, the ancient yellow sun that even now hangs above Cularin. Delicately etched into the swirl of yellow and red that makes up Morasil is a very distinct, human-shaped eye.**_
>
> _**The windows of the warehouse appear to have been broken, but cleanly, and the jagged bits removed from around their edges. A tired-looking Twi'lek sits on the front steps of the warehouse, gingerly rubbingthe tip of a head-tail on either temple. He stares at the ground and seems to be muttering to himself.**_

This is Manion Basca, owner of the Warehouse. He is more than a little distraught. When the heroes approach, read the following.

> _**The Twiílek looks up at you and sighs, continuing to rub a head-tail on either temple. ìYouíre not from Peace and Security.î He sighs. ìWhat do you want?î**_

Basca has been waiting here for a representative of OPS for two hours, since his warehouse was vandalized last night. Since nothing was taken, though, he was warned that it might take some time for officers to show up. And it has.

He can tell the heroes the following, with appropriate prompting or questioning:

- I got here this morning to see if the day shift bothered to show up. They didn't yesterday.
- I arrived and found the night shift already gone and this done to the front of my warehouse.
- I can't imagine who would want to do this.
- It looks kind of familiar, but not terribly. Nothing stands out.
- Yes, Gerta Haman worked here. She was part of the day shift that didn't show up yesterday, my inventory supervisor.
- No, her politics never bothered me. It didn't get in the way of her work. I just hope they didn't get her killed.
- No, there is no blood inside, no signs of violence other than the broken windows. And nothing was taken.

Heroes with any knowledge skill relevant to the local star system (astrogate counts) may make a roll to recognize what the stars represent. The amount of information they receive depends on the DC they meet. If nobody has any skill you deem relevant, just have them roll Intelligence and base what you give them off the chart below.

- DC 10: You're not sure what the stars represent, but you notice that Termadus, the second star of the system, is missing.
- DC 15: You notice that Termadus is missing, and you also think that the bright stars might represent habitable worlds in the system (Cularin, Almas ñ though Almas has needed to be terraformed)
- DC 20: Everything from DC 15, plus you suspect from their placement on the mural that the three dimmer stars might represent the habitable moons in the system (Dorumaa, terraformed over Almas; Ulbasca, over Genarius; and Tilnes, over
  Cularin).
- DC 25: All of the above, and the thickness of the
  lines connecting the various stars may correspond
  to trade routes.
- DC 30: You know way too much and should put skill points elsewhere. You might also consider not playing higher-level characters in low-level events, munchkin-boy.

There's not much else to be gained here. If the heroes are through all the places they can visit and have not figured out what to do next, go ahead and nudge the players to remind them they have Handout B as well, and hey, might there be some information to be found where some of these folks live?

## Encounter 3: Family, Friends, and Financiers

_Key idea of this encounter: more clues about where people are; more evidence pointing to the Hiironi as a source of information, a scuffle with a local loan shark who wants to get his hands on one of the missing individuals_

Well, Encounter 2 certainly was long, wasn't it? Let's make Encounter 3 a little easier off the bat. The heroes are able to find single-person dwellings for the following individuals: Gerta Haman, Broof Yurdel, Nyrkar, Nim'Ri. All of them have been cleaned out very thoroughly, not a single clue left. No furniture, no paper, no markings on the wall, no bootprints ñ nothing. It was a very deliberate cleaning. This leaves only two places to explore in this encounter, Shayne Gerarre's home, and Kris Wahl's home. A different type of problem awaits them at each locale.

### The Gerarre Household

Shayne Gerarre lives alone in a single-story dwelling on the west side of Gadrin, as far from the river as he could afford. A hundred meters of grassy open space separates his back door from the edge of the jungle, and sometimes small animals wander out of the jungle to graze.

> _**The simple white building before you looks like the austere dwelling of a Cerean. Plain, understated, and entirely functional, and decorated with symbols indicating a very expensive security system has been installed on the premises. The walkway leading to the door is lined with motion sensors, and the door itself is criss-crossed with flickering beams. A control pad is mounted on the wall beside the door. Scorch marks probably from a heavy blaster ñ mar the door, and there are signs of a struggle on the front lawn, but the house is quiet.**_

Shayne is with the resistance, and can be found later if the heroes look hard enough around the resistance HQ. He was almost taken by the Cartel, who were stopped at the last minute by a resistance force that caught them in the act.

The motion sensors along the walkway really don't do anything except prime the security system, so it doesn't matter if the heroes trigger them since when they get to the front door and start trying to figure out how to get inside, they'll end up priming the system anyway.

There is a summoning bell on the control panel. It will sound a bell inside the house ñ which the heroes can hear ñ but nothing will come of it. The heroes can either leave at this point, or they can attempt to bypass the security system. Given the likely pattern of events, it's not out of the realm of possibility for them to want to attempt to get into the home and see what they can learn, especially since this is the only home with an active security system and no one answering the door (at least, in this encounter!).

Bypassing the security system is easy. A Computer Use check with DC 7 is all that's required (yes, that's right, they don't even need Disable Device to do this, it's a simple algorithm ñ although, for dramatic effect, whatever the player rolls is "dead on what you needed," and it should be made to seem like they just avoided something horrific ñ which they didn't; it actually takes 3 failed attempts in a row before alarms sound and OPS is summoned). However, actually disabling the entire security system for the house requires a Disable Device check with DC 24. For most low-level groups, it is likely that the Computer Use checks will succeed, while the Disable Device check likely will not.

The trick, of course, is that Cereans have binary brains, and don't tend to think in terms of unitary security measures. They always have a backup, and any Cerean hero would know this as soon as the door's security system is bypassed. Feel free to pass any Cerean a note saying, "That was too easy. You know there must be more."

And there is more, provided the Disable Device checks failed, but it's not going to become evident until the heroes enter the house. Regardless, the following box-text applies.

> _**As you successfully bypass the door security system, the red beams that criss-crossed the door flicker and go out, and the door slides up to reveal a plain white hallway that leads to a door at the rear of the house. Half-way down the corridor is a pair of doors, one to either side. The floor is worked in an intricate interwoven tile pattern.**_

The seams among the tiles are actually slightly raised ñ a Spot check with DC 15 will allow heroes to notice this before stepping on them. The hallway is 3 meters wide, for purposes of creative problem solving on the part of the group, and the ceiling is four meters high. At the first point when six separate feet (usually, this will mean three bipedal humanoids) are touching the floor, if the entire security system was not disabled, Bad Things Happen. Do note that nothing will happen unless there are three heroes in the corridor at the same time.

If, however, that happens, have all the heroes in the corridor make a reflex save with DC 12 to jump back out the door as the electric grid in the floor activates. The grid delivers 4d6 electrical damage in the first round, save for half. Failure to save means the hero is still on the grid at the beginning of next round, at which point they must make a Fortitude save with DC 14 to remain conscious and get off the grid, or they will take another 4d6 (save negates in round 2, since it means they were able to retain consciousness and move quickly out of the corridor after their initial shock). Note that the grid will only continue to activate if there are still 6 feet on it, so it's unlikely that you will get to round 2 of damage-dealing with this. And if you do, well, someone's in trouble.

There are plenty of ways to get around this fairly unpleasant security measure. The easiest, of course, is to just go one or two at a time. The rooms themselves are not trapped.

There are four rooms to the house, two on the north end (the kitchen and comm center, separated only by a curtain) and two on the south end (the bedroom and study, also separated by a curtain). Nothing of interest is found in the kitchen or comm center, although an examination of the curtain between the rooms will reveal that one corner of the curtain previously had something sewn into it, something small (and based on the impression left in the cloth, probably a chip of some kind).

In the bedroom, beneath a pillow that was tossed in a corner (DC 15 Search check) is a datapad with a cracked screen. It is, however, salvageable, with a DC 12 Repair check. Without such a check, the only information that can be gleaned from it is a single word burned onto the screen: Hiironi. With such a check, the only useful data that can be obtained is that a contact with the Hiironi tribe knows of a "suitable location." All the other data has been wiped from the pad. There are some interesting documents in the study (particularly to a Cerean), including a partial recipe for the mixing of a Double-Dip Outer Rim Rumdrop

(Shayne Gerarre's specialty drink that made Spirited Spirits what it is), but nothing else to help the party.

### The Wahl Household

Kris Wahl is a scoundrel, a wastrel, and a layabout, a louse who has been living off his family's money from the day he was born. Much to the chagrin of his parents, however, he also has a conscience, so while he inherited many of their vices (including a sizeable gambling debt), he also tossed a good deal of money to "worthless philanthropic nonsense" that his parents know little about. This would include providing a large number of credits to his friend, Gerta Haman, for some relief project she wanted to sponsor for the indigenous species of Cularin.

> _**The Wahl mansion is one of the nicest in Hedrett, and is the only single-family dwelling of more than two levels in either city. The grounds are well tended, and security droids stand along the walkway leading to the door. A prim young woman dressed in red stands at the door and bows slightly at your approach.**_
>
> _**"Greetings. Are you here to see Dr. and Mr. Wahl?"**_

Dr. Wahl, Kris's mother, is a well-known biotechnical surgeon specializing in cybernetics, and her husband is a slacker. This is also well known throughout the community.

Both of the Wahls are well into their middle years, with silver-gray hair and plenty of wrinkles. They will greet and speak with the heroes in the foyer.

Things the Wahls can tell the party:

- Yes, our son is missing.
- He's got some problems, but we don't think anyone would wish him ill.
- Oh, you know, gambling debts and things like that.
- We're more concerned about his associations with certain persons. Oh, what is her name, dear? That Haman woman. Bad influence, she is.
- He gave her money. What a waste. Wanting to "protect the indigenous peoples of Cularin." [If there are any Tarasin heroes in the party, Dr. Wahl will explain that they are quite capable of protecting themselves, and don't need handouts to
  do so.]
- She put all sorts of ideas in his head about danger to the planet, to the system. Alarmist witch.
- Yes, he did mention the Hiironi on occasion. Why do you ask?

That is basically all they know. If told that Gerta is also missing, the Wahls will not be surprised, and will speculate that Kris ran off with her on some foolish errand or other. Which is actually pretty close to the truth.

Upon leaving the Wahl estates, the heroes will be stopped by Polst, who has been watching for anything that might lead him to Kris ñ who owes him a sizeable number of credits.

> _**You've gone less than a block when you round a corner and find yourself faced with one of the most unattractive humans you've ever seen. The right half of his face is a mass of scars, which extend back over his head, completely covering the spot where his right ear should be. The left half of his face, by contrast, looks almost normal, if very unhappy. His right arm hangs limp at his side, and he wears a blaster on his left hip, his good hand hovering above it.**_
>
> _**"I dunno who you are," he growls, "but you look like you know where little Kris might be. So why don't you just give him to me, and I won't have to kill you."**_

The heroes can try to talk Polst out of a fight, but it's not likely to work. He doesn't have many men with him, though, but he's not concerned since the party looks somewhat disorganized to his "highly trained" eye.

Polst doesn't actually have a permit to carry a functioning blaster in the city, because of his criminal record, so he has no power cell for the weapon and will let his thugs do most of the fighting. They also don't carry blasters, since it might make their boss look bad. In other words, it shouldn't be much of a fight, and when it's done, if Polst is captured, he doesn't know anything about Kris except that the young man owes him over a thousand credits (1138, to be precise), which he would very much like to collect.

## Encounter 4: The Hiironi

_Key ideas of this encounter: visiting the Hiironi tribe; learning about the Tarasin; meeting Dariana, mother of the Hiironi; learning about activity at cloud mountain_

The Hiironi irstadt is the largest and best known on Cularin, and as such, a route has been partially cleared through the jungle to it. The amount of traffic between the settlements and the Hiironi is enough to typically keep predators away, especially since most of the traders who move through the area do so armed. And while the jungle dwellers may be large reptiles, they are not stupid. In a word: Blasters hurt!

When they head for the trail that leads to the Hiironi, the heroes will meet up with one such group of traders. They are not completely what they seem, however

> _**At the edge of Gadrin a swath of jungle has been removed, creating a road that leads off into the dense foliage. A silver archway stretches above the entrance to the road, and several large-capacity speeders sit in the clearing, being loaded with supplies. Two humans ñ a man and a woman ñ are giving orders to a mixed crew of Rodians, Sullustans, and a trio of muscular Trandoshans. The Trandoshans are large, even for their species.**_
>
> _**At your approach, the woman breaks away from the rest with a frown and walks to meet you.**_

This is a "relief" mission, organized by two young Force Adepts, San Herrera and Nia Reston. Neither of them believes the Jedi academy is quite right for them ñ the discipline is rumored to be fairly strict ñ but they're convinced that they need to do good work. They've hired a large number of laborers to assist them, and are ostensibly going to trade with the Hiironi, but the trading is typically fairly one-sided, since they cannot get the kind of prices for the goods they get from the Hiironi that they could for what they provide.

Neither San nor Nia have any way to mask their Force-Sensitivity.

> _**"Hello." The young woman has jet-black hair, streaked with silver. She cocks her head and looks at each of you. "Are you here about the job?"**_

The job, of course, is helping haul the goods out to the Hiironi irstadt, and it pays 100 credits per laborer. It also provides a group with whom the party can travel, if they so desire. Nia can answer the following questions, but really wants to get underway, so will politely brush off other inquiries, saying, **_We're really got a lot of work to do. Are you interested in coming with us? If so, just grab a box and start loading._**

What are you doing? **_We're going to trade with the Hiironi.._**

Trade what? **_They need technical supplies to improve their quality of life. They have some amazing exotic crafts._**

You know the way to the tribe well? **_We've done this dozens of times. It's perfectly safe._**

So you're affiliated with one of the big trading houses? **_No, we're a private concern._**

San and Nia are very friendly, and if anyone identifies them as Force-users, they will readily admit that they are in the process of honing their skills. Questions about the Jedi academy will be answered politely as outlined above. They like the idea, but don't think it's right for them.

None of the laborers think anything of the job. They make runs like this quite frequently, and the Hiironi irstadt is one of the safest to trade with. Most traders don't take this quality supplies to the Tarasin, however. This is all top-grade gear, and there's nothing any of the laborers have ever seen that is worth this kind of investment. Either Nia or San will shrug at such assertions, saying it is purely a matter of perspective.

The trip is otherwise uneventful. Likewise, if the heroes decide to go on their own, nothing bad happens, they just don't get the perspective on San and Nia's actions.

> _**Arriving at the Hiironi irstadt, you see a great bustle of activity, Tarasin going about their daily activities ñ cleaning, cooking, trading, talking. All of the things that make up daily life in every settlement, every village, around the galaxy.**_
>
> _**Relaxed in their safe home environment, the Hiironi all possess a light brown hue, although some of them, in conversations about one thing or another, do look slightly tinged with pinks or reds or greens. Most of them pay you little attention as Nia and San lead the small caravan of speeders into the center of the village, amidst the ornate wooden buildings, and begin offloading their goods.**_
>
> _**No sooner have they begun than the huge wooden double-doors of the largest building open and a procession of Tarasin females emerges. They wear the symbols of several different irstadt, with one of them ñ a tallish Tarasin who would hardly be noticeable if not for a tattoo of a thin, snakelike lizard that began below her jaw and whose tail curled up around her ear-slit ñ carrying an ornate wooden staff. As she exits the building she turns, bows her head, and holds the staff before her. A grizzled Tarasin hand reaches out the doorway and takes the staff, and the most venerable, austere Tarasin you've seen steps proudly from the building.**_

This is Dariana, Mother of the Hiironi.

> _**She looks around the irstadt and her eyes settle on the traders unloading the boxes of goods.**_
>
> _**She raises the staff skyward, and the quills on the back of her arm stand out straight to either side. "I sense a disturbance. And there are those here who have also sensed the disturbance."**_

At this, San and Nia will start forward, but Dariana will wave them back. She will then point to the heroes with her staff.

> _**"You. You will attend me. Now." And with that she turns and walks back into the building.**_

Dariana doesn't know precisely what's going on, but she has a good idea. The disturbance she has sensed is not in the Force ñ though it does manifest there ñ but instead in the balance of nature near Cloud Mountain. Specifically, on the far side of the mountain from the cities is an abandoned mineral mine. (It was rumored to hold great quantities of several rare minerals, but none of them ever materialized in the amounts hoped, and the mine's financial backing disappeared.) She is aware of a great deal of activity there, upsetting the local inhabitants, who have begun to migrate to other areas.

She is very kindly and older, but sharp as a tack. She wants what is best for the jungle, and will make it clear that the other Tarasin who just left want the same. They were a delegation from many irstadts who were meeting to discuss how to retain their identity in the face of change on Cularin.

If she is asked about the datapad and its reference to a "suitable location," she will nod thoughtfully. While there are many locations in the jungle suitable for many things, she was asked recently by a friend of the irstadt ñ whose name she will not divulge ñ about a region where a minor sanctuary could be established. She recommended Cloud Mountain, and that's one of the reasons she's been aware of the changes there lately. She doesn't know what kind of "sanctuary" her friend wanted, but has been somewhat worried that the upheavals in the area might disturb what sanctuary there was. Any indication that the heroes are thinking of going there will be met with a nod of approval.

If asked about the traders, she will simply sigh. Most of what they bring, the Hiironi don't need, but it seems to make the young people feel good to help out the primitives, so

## Encounter 5: Cloud Mines

_Key idea of this encounter: find the mine entrance, infiltrate; a chase by security droids through the mineshafts_

Directions to the mines on Cloud Mountain are easy to obtain. The only useable entrance to the mines is located æ of the way up the mountain, on the opposite side from the cities. The early miners who built (and subsequently abandoned) the mine clear-cut that entire side of the mountain, so it's easy to see that there is nothing waiting in ambush ñ but equally easy to get nervous that someone may see them coming. The Hiironi irstadt is only a kilometer from the base of the mountain, and the trek is not overly harsh or dangerous.

Nia and San will thank the heroes for their help (if given the opportunity) and provide them with credit chips for the agreed-upon amount.

> _**You emerge from the jungle to see the bald northern face of Cloud Mountain rising before you. From this vantage point, staring up the steep brown incline, you can easily see where it got its name, as several fluffy clouds have gathered around its peak, obscuring it from view.**_
>
> _**The mountainside is relatively steep, with not a tree, bush, or meaningful clump of grass anywhere on it. Just dirt and rocks, from where you stand all the way to where the mountain disappears into the clouds, a swath a hundred meters wide all the way up. The brown of the mountainside is broken only by a black spot several hundred meters up, surrounded by a gleam of silver. That, based on what you've been told, must be the entrance to the mines.**_

Feel free to have lots of noises coming from the nearby treeline as the heroes make their way up the mountain, but there's nothing that wants to attack them in that area. When they get up near the entrance to the mines, lots of tracks are visible, some of them fairly recent. An access panel is off to one side of the entrance to the mines, but the entrance itself stands open. The opening is ten feet tall and twenty feet wide, with tracks on which blast doors may have once slid. Now, only the metal frame of the entrance remained, firmly anchored in the mountainside.

The access panel is not active, and has not been since the blast doors that used to bar entrance to the mine shaft were removed. Examining the tracks on which the doors used to operate makes it clear that they were removed in a hurried fashion, with little regard for future usage of the facilities.

However, not all of the security for the mines was disabled. A set of security droids were left here, since their programming was so simple and linear as to make them virtually useless anywhere else, and because removing all security meant that the owners relinquished their claims to the mine. A successful knowledge check (based on either bureaucracy or business; other checks may be deemed relevant as well) with DC 12 will allow heroes to know that some sort of security is probably still in place, since it is unlikely the owners would completely give up the claim.

And sure enough, just inside the main door to the mine is a silver switch-box labeled "SECURITY" with a single switch that is currently set to "On" and has only one other setting, the label for which has been scratched off. It could have read "Off," but if so, it was in a much larger font than the "On."

Disassembling the box and attempting to determine what it does requires a DC 17 check on whatever skill the hero says is relevant. In other words, this information isn't critical, so if they make an effort and succeed at the roll, you can tell them that it controls an alarm system which is currently active, and which will be run through a test routine ñ probably a very loud one ñ if the switch is pulled. And of course, if they just pull the switch, the alarms go off in their test pattern.

If they do nothing to the box, nothing happens immediately. If they attempt to disable the device, it's a DC 26 check to do so, and this buys them 3 free rounds where they won't be chased by the security droids.

> _**Ahead of you begin the magnetic tracks that lead down into the mine. Several turbocarts wait beside those tracks, looking to be in good shape.**_

The turbocarts are all quite serviceable, and each can hold 4 individuals. The controls are simple, since the turbocarts, as modified speeders, are basically on autopilot to take their passengers from the top of the mine to the bottom. Once in place, the carts will hover above the tracks and wait for someone to press the "start" button. The carts require no steering, and only have two speeds ñ stop and go. "Go" is pretty impressively fast. Around 120 km/hour.

The heroes are welcome to try walking, but the gauges on the carts indicate that the bottom of the mine is probably several kilometers down (which it is, that's just not where the heroes will end up; they're only going about 4 km down). The carts are a much better idea than walking, although they're welcome to walk if that's really what they want to do.

If they walk, they will come to a long stretch where the tunnel floor has collapsed and nothing but the magnetic cart tracks remains. They cannot see the far side of the pit, nor can they see its bottom. It is actually 100 meters across, and 70 meters down. The tracks are barely wide enough to walk along, and will require a DC 12 Dex check every 10 meters or the hero will fall ñ and probably die. That is to say at this point, they should probably head back and get a cart, or they can be creative and try another way to get across. Use your discretion.

Once the "Start" button is pressed on any cart and it begins to move with passengers, the heroes have a five-round head start on the security droids who are going to come after them in a turbocart of their own. This is adjusted by successfully deactivating the security system (+3 rounds) and can be further adjusted by attempting to block the tracks with other objects (say, another turbocart "fixed" to not run; this would be +2 rounds). It will take a total of 20 rounds to reach the bottom ñ yes, they're moving THAT fast!

The following breakdown assumes a standard 5 round head start. You may adjust as necessary. For purposes of Defense, treat being in a turbocart as providing a cover bonus of +4 for all heroes unless they do something that would specifically modify their cover bonus. If they say they are hiding inside the cart, then they have no chance of being hit, but there's no need to tell them that immediately! Also, the carts themselves are impervious to blaster fire (but for your reference, the tracks are not, though the droids will not shoot at them, the players may).

- Rounds 1-5: Descent
- Round 6: A whirring in the distance behind them as
  another turbocart gets on the track.
- Round 7-10: The other cart is catching up, able to
  move much more quickly because the droids
  within won't turn to goo if THEY go too fast.
- Round 11: The first shots are fired. This is where
  you should roll initiative.
- Rounds 12-19: Firefight, whizzing through the
  mines. (If you like, have players rearrange their chairs into the places they're seated in the 2 carts, and stand behind them rolling dice for the droids firing on them.) Describe this as vividly as you can: the blaster shots bouncing off the cavern walls or the bodies of the turbocarts, the rush of the air past their faces, etc.
- Round 20: The heroes' cart comes to a stop, and if they are still being chased, they can shut the blast doors at the base of the mine shaft and watch as the droids' turbocart slams into it from the other side and makes a nice dent. Make sure the blast door closes JUST IN TIME

Note that the carts have REALLY good breaks, and the wall in front of where they stop is padded, in case anyone goes flying forward. There is no chance, in other words, of the heroes crashing and burning at the end of the run.

The security droids actually attach themselves to the outside edges of the cart so that all three of them can fire at once, so do not benefit from the cover bonus the heroes get for the carts.

## Encounter 6: None May Pass

_Key idea of this encounter: test a few more skills of the heroes, and their problem-solving ability; meet a representative of the resistance at the end of the process_

> _**The tunnel in which you find yourselves has been neatly carved from the rock, and the walls, floor, and ceiling shorn up with metal plates that gleam in flickering fluorescent lights for as far as you can see. It looks like the magnetic track for your carts continued on at one point. The tracks run up to the far wall, then stop. Examining it, you see that the tracks seem to have been welded to the wall by some great source of heat, and there is no way to get through.**_

Technically not a true statement, of course. They can get through and find the tunnel on the far side of the wall completely collapsed and impassable. Tons upon tons of rock lie before them, and it is obvious that the tunnel simply doesn't exist any more. Everything has settled, and there's no way through.

This leaves them one other direction to go, and that is down the tunnel that stretches off into the heart of the mountain.

> _**As you travel, you begin to notice increasing numbers of makeshift panels on the walls. Most of them are about a meter square, and placed seemingly at random. Each of them bears the emblem of a pair of narrow, slitted eyes, peering out from the "face" of a rising sun.**_

See [Player Handout D](/player-handouts/10d) for a picture of this emblem. This is the corporate logo for Sunburst mining, the failed operation. The panels are patches to cover holes that were drilled out of desperation toward the end of the mining company's operation. They are easy to remove, and will reveal shallow drill sites that clearly turned up nothing useful and were quickly abandoned.

The tunnel leads them to a closed blast door with a LCD. The word "PASSWORD?" flashes on the LCD, and a full keyboard rests on a metal shelf directly below.

The password is "RAVI" (not case sensitive, can even include a hyphen), and if it is entered (or a DC 30 disable device check is made) then the traps that await the heroes on the far side of the door will be disarmed. Even if they get it wrong or fail the check, the door will still slide open on the first try. All the text below assumes that the heroes did not successfully disarm anything. If they did, well, then they walk right through to the interview at the end of the encounter, avoiding the two somewhat unpleasant traps.

NOTE: Do NOT give them INT checks or anything else to figure out the password. They have no reason to know it, but if they take a shot in the dark, based on the clue found in Nim'Ri's office, and get it right, then they deserve to get through without any trouble. Fortune favors the bold, after all.

### Trap 1: Haven't We Seen This Before?

When the last hero passes through the blast door beyond the password station, unless they managed to figure out the password or disable the device, the fun begins.

> _**As the last member of your party passes through the blast doors, the doors SLAM shut and a great grinding whir begins all around you. You stand in a room ten meters square, littered with scrap metal, most of which is bent and twisted beyond recognition, but some of which looks an awful lot like droid pieces. The ceiling of the room is vaulted, rising to a point perhaps five meters above the floor at its center, but is only a little over three meters high at both the right and left walls.**_

Listen checks, please. DC 14. Success means they know that the whirring is coming from the walls on either side of them, some sort of large motor.

And then the walls begin to move in.

Now, the heroes have a few options. First, they can try to brace the walls with the scrap metal, but as we all know, you do that, the metal bends or breaks, and you're in trouble again. There are a couple of long beams they can try this with, if they just don't believe it.

They can also attempt to scale the walls. They're patchwork metal, and only 3 meters tall, so DC 15, 10 if they have someone boost them up. As the walls move in, toward the center of the room, a gap emerges between the top of the wall and the ceiling, since the ceiling is getting gradually higher toward the center of the room. When the walls are five meters apart, there will be enough space for a hero to scramble over the wall and into the area behind, where the mechanism that moves the wall is located. Similarly, if they all have a way to get up to the ceiling and can stay there while the walls come together and move back apart, that works as well.

Now, there is a door out of the room. And if any of your heroes are surprised that it's magnetically sealed (as is the door through which they came, incidentally), smack them. Remember, shooting blasters at magnetically sealed doors is a Bad Thing. There is a 10% chance that any such shot will rebound and hit one of the heroes (roll randomly based on who is a target in range of the rebound), but it will only do o of the dice damage (and NO CRITS).

There are any number of ways the heroes can avoid this trap, including some Force abilities. The trick is for them to be creative. If they come up with something that will work in the 15 rounds it will take the walls to come together and smoosh them all into two dimensions, then don't stand in their way. If they decide to sit there and call for help, well, then there's not much you can do. Just make sure you make it clear that after seven rounds, there is a big enough space between the top of the wall and the ceiling that even a Wookiee could get through it.

Going to either side allows them access to a machinery room where they can turn off, smash, blast, or do any of a number of nasty things to the mechanism that's moving the walls. There is also a power switch to the magnetically sealed exit to the room, or another doorway that also leads them into the next trapped area.

### Trap 2: Is it Just Me, or is it Getting WARM?

> _**Exiting the rather unpleasant room with the moving walls, you find yourselves in another long corridor. This one dips and curves further into the mountain. Every hundred meters you pass another blast door, and as you step through it closes behind you.**_

These are heat-sensor activated, by the way. The sensors are hidden in the ceiling, and are able to tell when a room is no longer occupied. Detecting these sensors requires a DC 18 spot check, since they are concealed behind small panels. They can certainly be rigged with a temporary heat source to "fool them" into believing the rooms are still occupied, particularly by a Gearhead. If they make a point to do this in every section of the corridor, the heat sensors won't set off the heat trap that awaits.

If they don't do anything but let the doors shut behind them, then they have to deal with the following.

> _**As the fifth set of blast doors slides shut behind you, a set of small panels slides down from the ceiling and begin to glow red. The air around you begins to shimmer as the temperature rapidly rises! The doors behind you slide open once more, offering a way out.**_

The panels that drop from the ceiling are heating coils connected to the heat sensors. These sensors are the same as the others, except that they trigger when someone enters the room rather than leaving (although they will only trigger if the previous sensors have also triggered to shut the doors), and they cut off after the ambient temperature in the tunnel reaches 450° or when the sensors in the previous room indicate that the "intruders" have begun leaving. It's not a trap, per se, but instead is a security measure designed to encourage trespassers to rethink their decision to go further.

So there are options. They can jump back through the doorway, at which point the heating coils will retract into the ceiling. They can also run. They have 200 meters ahead of them, and will start taking damage in the second round. It's an unpleasant progression, taking 1d4 in round 2 and again in round 3, 2d4 in round 4 and 5, and 3d4 in each round thereafter. They can also blast the heating coils as they drop down (Defense of 14 because of their small size, but a successful hit will pop each one in turn), or if they can come up with a way to mask their body heat (assuming they figure out what's going on, which they can if they have any relevant mechanical skills) that works as well.
Again, this is not meant to kill anyone who is willing to stop and think, but it may well kill those who rush blindly ahead. It's another opportunity for them to try things out, and if it's reasonable ñ and particularly if it's CINEMATIC, then let them describe it, and it should work.

### An Interview

> _**You emerge from the hot, cramped corridor into a large, much cooler cavern of worked stone. The only metal in the cavern is a long table on the far side of the room, behind which three individuals sit. One of them, a Trandoshan, looks familiar, but the other two ñ a human woman and a Gungan ñ you only know of by reputation.**_

Nim'Ri will nod to each of the heroes he has met before, and will begin his greeting with, "I see you plan on staying involved in what is best for the system. That's good." Just insert that at the beginning of the box text below if it's relevant.

> _**The Trandoshan stands. "Welcome. I apologize for the trials you may have had to endure, but they are necessary to ensure those whom we would keep out retain their distance. These are my friends, my companions, Gerta and Broof." He gestures to the human and the Gungan in turn. "It is only fair to warn you that while we may have known each other in the city, here is a different world. You cannot see them, but there are blasters trained on you. If you offer your word that you will not harm us, that will suffice and we will order the blasters deactivated. Then we will talk, and once we are done talking, we will decide what to do with you."**_

There are, in fact, a large number of blasters ñ all set to stun ñ trained on the heroes. No one will be killed if the heroes don't cooperate, but they will be shot until unconscious, then taken back to the surface.

None of the three at the table are armed, and Nim'Ri will ask the heroes to disarm as well, though will not object if they retain their weapons. He will cock an eyebrow, but nod and allow them to keep their weapons if they insist.

> _**"You probably have questions. But we hope that you will answer some of ours first.**_
>
> _**"What are you doing here?"**_

Honesty is good here. Answers dealing with investigating the disappearance of so many people ñ including these three ñ will earn nods from the panel. This is your opportunity to bring a quiet player into the action, since you can direct the question to any of the heroes you like, and I would encourage you to do so. You can let any or all of the heroes answer the questions posed by the panel.

Answers dealing with the good of the system will also be received well.

> _**"You've done a great deal of searching to find us. Why do you believe we're here?"**_

Anything about organizing against the Cartel is a good answer as, again, is any answer dealing with the safety of the Cularin system. Any answer that is just way out in left field will earn confused looks from the panel, and they will look at each other and shrug.

When the heroes have all offered speculation, Gerta will explain that they have left their homes to discuss how to stop the Metatheran Cartel from succeeding where the Trade Federation failed in Cularin. The patterns are the same, and they fear that if something is not done, life as they know it in the system will be changed forever. She continues with their final question.

> _**"What we are doing here is of critical importance. Why should we trust you to not betray us?"**_

This is one question that each hero must answer on his or her own. Again, an honest answer is best. Even, "You shouldn't trust anyone, if it's that critical, but I'm as good as any" will be grudgingly accepted. However, as before, anything about wanting to protect their homes, or the system as a whole, will be well received. "Because I don't want you to kill me" will be met with, "We will not kill you regardless. That's their way ñ not ours. Your safety is guaranteed, so with that said, why should we trust you to not betray us?"
Flippant answers to any of the questions will be received with serious looks, and an admonition to "Reconsider whether that is how you truly feel."

When all the heroes have had a chance to answer, Nim'Ri, Broof, and Gerta will briefly consult, and unless the heroes were just complete buffoons and not at all heroic in their answers, Broof will finally speak.

> _**"Yousa comen with us. Deysa here, ganna get bombad. Yousa know what's what. Now wesa show you what wesa do."**_

And with that they rise, and lead the party into a tunnel behind the table, deeper into the mountain.

## Encounter 7: The Resistance

_Key ideas of this encounter: actually getting to ask questions of Gerta, the leader; learning that they have almost enough information to prove the cartel is up to no good; being faced with a decision of how much to tell E1-6RA_

> \_**The trio leads you down the tunnel, which angles sharply into the mountain. From the rough face of the tunnel walls, it looks like this tunnel is natural, rather than cut by any of the drilling equipment commonly used in operations of this type.**
>
> _**Every twenty meters or so, a shape emerges from a shadowy alcove as you pass and falls in step behind your party. Most of them are Gungans, who greet Broof with, "Hello dare, da big boss Broof sir!" or something similar. Broof does a half-wave, half-salute to each of them, and continues walking.**_

The heroes are free to ask questions at this point. It's not a long walk, but it's long enough. In general, the trio each has a different focus in their responses. Nim'Ri is focused on doing what is right and best for the system as a whole, to retain freedom. Gerta is focused on the inhabitants of the system, particularly the Tarasin, and retaining the dignity of the people. Broof is much more concerned with being heroic and fighting off his oppressors like he did at the Battle of Naboo than he is with any kind of civil rights.

Nim'Ri can tell them:

- I had to leave my job. For the time being, this is
  more important.
- I believe strongly in what we're doing here.
- The fate of the system rests in our hands.

Gerta can tell them:

- Yes, this is related to my concerns for the Tarasin.
  I see you did your homework.
- It affects them, but it affects all of us.
- We can talk proof later.
- We should not be subject to this kind of
  manipulation by the Cartel, it's as bad as the Trade Federation. [This will make Broof snort derisively, since he's seen what the Trade Federation did, and it was much worse than this.]

Broof can tell them:

- Wesa ganna fight!
- Gungans are warriors!
- After da Battle of Naboo, mesa come here, looken for work since da bombad Traders gone. And what did mesa find? Bombad Trader wannabes! Ee- gods!
- Wesa fought da Traders and da bombad droid army, now wesa doen it again. Did mesa say Gungans are warriors?

Yes, you may use your Jar Jar voice for Broof, but he's much more purposely competent than Binks ñ whom he never met, but whom he heard did great things at the battle. There were a lot of Gungans there, after all, and Binks (he refers to him by his last name) wasn't one who was around Otoh Gunga much before the battle, since he'd been banished. So he knows him by reputation only.

After everyone's had a chance to talk to the trio, proceed to the following.

> _**The tunnel opens up into an enormous natural cavern, lit by jury-rigged rows of lights set atop poles that weave among a tent city. Males and females of all species mill about, probably close to 200 of them all told, most of whom nod respectfully as the trio you are with walks past.**_
>
> _**A large, multicolored tent occupies the center of the cavern, easily fifty meters across and probably ten meters high. The flaps stand open, and Nim'Ri takes up a position on one side of the flaps with Broof on the other. Gerta looks over her shoulder at you and gestures for you to follow.**_
>
> _**Inside is more activity, with several banks of computers set up, lights flashing and printers whirring as data is spewed forth at an impressive pace. In the center of the tent is a round table, a datapad set into the tableface before each chair. Gerta takes a seat and gestures for each of you to do the same.**_
>
> _**"This is our temporary base of operations. Tomorrow, we can move, if need be. That will depend on you, since you are the only individuals not part of the resistance to find us. But you will make whatever decision you make, and that will be the will of the Force.**_
>
> _**"I am willing to answer questions for you, if I can, to help you make up your mind as to what you will do. We won't kill you unless you make yourself into a threat that cannot be dealt with any other way, so speak freely."**_

So okay, what's the deal here? **_"We have gathered evidence that the Metatheran Cartel is behind the acts of piracy that have been going on recently on the planet's surface. I organized this resistance because it had to be done. I guess I'm the leader."_**

If you have evidence, why haven't you done anything with it? **_"Because it's incomplete. The credit trail dries up just before it gets back to the Cartel, but we know."_**

So what are you doing? Are you going to attack? **_"We would prefer to avoid bloodshed. Well, most of us would. You saw all those computers out there, right now they're accessing every databank they can find to try and tie the Cartel to what's going on. But they've covered their tracks well enough that we're coming up short every time."_**

Then how do you know? **_"Because the Tarasin have sensed the wrongness in the Caarites. Because we have seen that they cut the Ch'hala trees."_** [NOTE: This is SACRILEGE to any Tarasin hero, the Ch'hala trees are beautiful with thick, drooping branches and greenish-purple bark that swirls with color whenever it's touched.] She presses the screen of her datapad and the other datapads spring to life, showing a short scene of a Caarite work force taking a heavy laser cutting tool to a Ch'hala tree in full bloom. While there is no sound, the camera shakes as the great tree crashes to the ground, flowers falling into the grass.

If you knew this, why didn't you do something? **_"They would deny it, would claim we doctored the video. No one wants to believe them capable of this, but I saw it with my own eyes. They are only here for the goods, and will slowly deplete the resources and the culture of the planet, until there is nothing left."_**

Why should we believe you? **_"I'm a woman who worked in a warehouse. I have nothing to gain by lying to you. If I'm right or if I'm wrong, I go back to the same job. It's a question of what kind of world I'll be working in when it's all done. What kind of world we'll all be working in. I'm doing this because it has to be done, same as everyone else here."_**

Gerta truly doesn't have any reason to lie, and will be as honest as she can. As to future plans, they're going to continue gathering information so they can have the Cartel expelled from the system. All of them agree that they want the Cartel gone; it's simply a matter of how it gets accomplished. They don't want to fight, but with Broof's very competent soldiers, they can if it comes to that.

Based on other information available in this scenario, you can answer other questions the heroes may have. When they are done, Gerta will ask them to not tell anyone of the resistance. She will plead with any hero who expresses a desire to tell Dariana of the cutting of the Ch'hala trees not to do so, to prevent needless bloodshed. She believes the resistance is able to deal with the Cartel, or will be, soon, and doesn't want it to escalate to bloodshed. If told that the heroes were originally hired by E1-6RA, she will frown.

> _**"She will want to know what you found. Well, you can tell her that all of the people you mentioned to me are here, and safe. We've put Shayne and Nyrkar to work for us, and Kris is one of our financial backers, bless his soul. And the rest of them are here as well. Everyone is healthy and happy, but if you could please not tell her where we are, or what we plan I trust the Jedi, but they might attempt to intervene and negotiate, and negotiations favor the Cartel. It's what they DO."**_

She will thank the heroes, wish them well, and encourage them to consider joining up. She could use a group with the tenacity to find her well-hidden base on her team. Any heroes who want to join up will be told they will be contacted in a few days ñ standard background check, no big deal ñ and then brought in to the organization. [No certs provided, since there is no marked in-game benefit to being a member of the resistance at this time.]

IF THE HEROES GO BACK TO DARIANA: Dariana is wise enough to not act hastily. She is going to take some time to meditate on what she has been told before deciding how to deal with the transgression against the Tarasin way of life. She will shed a single tear as the heroes leave.

## Conclusion

> _**You arrive for your meeting with E1-6RA at the appointed place and time. Unsurprisingly, the droid is a few minutes late, and when she walks in, she casually looks you over before taking a seat in the same rickety chair she used for your previous meeting.**_
>
> _**"You have information for me?"**_

The heroes may tell E1-6RA as much or as little as they like. The most critical piece of information she needs to hear is that all the citizens are well, and that they left of their own accord. Once she hears that, she and Lanius will be able to intuit a great deal. She will calmly note everything she is told. She will only ask basic, probing questions, since she does not want to pressure the heroes. She will preface her questions with the statement, "I understand that there may be things you do not wish to tell me. I simply want to ensure that the situation does not represent a threat to the system that Master Lanius must act upon." Things she wants to know:

- Who are they?
- What do they want?
- How many are there now?
- Do they need negotiators?
- Do they intend violence?
- Where are they?

It is critical, for the first run, that you complete the event summary form at the end of this scenario and turn it in to HQ. What the players do and do not tell E1-6RA will determine, to some extent, what happens in Episode III: Revelation and Refutation.

Once the heroes have answered all the questions they are willing to answer, E1-6RA will thank them and, if they were generally cooperative (note that this does NOT mean "totally spilled their guts," it simply means, did they tell her what she needed to know about the safety of the missing persons and the safety of the system) will offer each of them her assurance that if they need assistance from either herself or Master Lanius, they need only contact the academy. And with that, she will wish them luck in what will likely be a trying time to come.

**Here Ends _The Resistance Within_**

### Experience Point Summary

Experience is calculated as follows for Living Force events.

1. Experience awards in the SWRPG are not made for
   achieving objectives, but instead for successfully completing an adventure of a given length. Thus, if the heroes survived and accomplished the primary goal of the adventure, they receive full Adventure Experience (600 xp for core LF plot scenarios, 350 for non-core LF scenarios).
2. Assign discretionary role-playing experience (0- 400 points). These should reward accurate character portrayal throughout the adventure, not just how well the PC interacted socially. Do NOT automatically award max roleplaying XP, consider carefully how well the players stayed in-character. This is your opportunity to reward appropriately cinematic behavior, so use it!

### Adventure Experience Award:

Did the heroes learn about the resistance and return to E1-6RA? If so, each hero who survived receives 600 xp. If the heroes do not complete the mission due to time constraints, but were generally "on the right track," award them x of the total adventure experience.

If they found the resistance but did not return for their meeting with E1-6RA, award them æ of the total adventure experience.
Note that the amount of roleplaying experience heroes receive is not tied to how far the heroes get in the scenario.

|                            |         |
| -------------------------- | ------- |
| Adventure Experience:      | 600xp   |
| Roleplaying Experience:    | 0-400xp |
| Total Possible Experience: | 1,000xp |

### Loot Summary

Player characters may keep items from the scenario that are listed on the loot list below or which meet the following conditions:

1. The item must be specifically listed in the text of the adventure (e.g. body armor on foes). If it is not listed in the text, the characters cannot keep it. Items of this nature can be sold for 50% of book value, or recorded on a character sheet.
2. Animals, followers, monsters, henchmen, droids, and so forth (any living being, basically) may not be kept from a scenario for any reason unless the treasure summary lists the being specifically. It is okay for the player characters to form relationships with NPCs, but these will not be certed and cannot bring material benefit to the character. Contacts (sources of extra information) must be specifically certed.
3. Theft is against the law, but may be practiced by some player characters. Items worth more than 1000 credits that are of personal significance to the owner (including family heirlooms) will be discovered in the possession of the character by one means or another. The character must return the item and pay a fine equal to three times the value of the item stolen. In addition, the PC caught receives campaign-decided penalties for being known as a thief. For other stolen items which meet the criteria in #1 above, use your judgment and the circumstances within the game to determine whether a PC thief gets away with the theft or not.

Any item retained according to these rules, which does not have a certificate, will not ever have a certificate issued for it.

The campaign staff reserves the right to take away any item or credits acquired for things it later finds unreasonable but which were allowed at the time.

#### From E1-6RA

- Favor of Lanius Qel'Bertuk and E1-6RA (potentially one per hero): For answering E1-6RA's need for assistance, the hero named above may
  request Lanius to intervene on their behalf in a single important negotiation. This favor may only be redeemed if there is a reasonable way to contact Lanius at the Jedi Academy available to the hero, and even so, it requires 1d4 hours to obtain as Lanius is very busy. If the requested intervention in ANY WAY violates ANY aspect of the Jedi Code, Lanius will refuse to assist in the negotiation (for example, this favor cannot be used to lie, cheat, steal, or deal in black market merchandise). If Lanius can be reached and agrees to assist, his intervention provides a circumstance bonus of +20 to a single diplomacy check. Once the request is made, whether Lanius accepts or refuses to help, this favor should be voided. Multiple favors from different heroes cannot be used to get higher bonuses to a single diplomacy check roll.
- 1 holorecorder

#### From the Resistance (assuming success):

- 3 liters, Double-Dip Outer Rim Rumdrop
- 2 weeks' dry rations
- 2 all-temperature cloaks

#### From San and Nia:

- 100 credit chip (per pc)
